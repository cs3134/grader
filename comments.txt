this joke has been around longer than most administrators
stop stigmatizing sexual acts
dumplings
also
better than last year
this was the only time during the fireside chat that the issue of adjunct and associate professors used to supplement fulltime professors was raised at all
years ago
a joke
sad and true
could you please start linking to the google docs
what about the key replacement fee
you know you want to
why we applied to barnard lol
about beta
does nt smell like beta to me
okay
these boys got ta get chewed out by administration
nonissue
as if women are posessions to be  gotten   check your premises
if you ever feel like your safety is being compromised call public safety or 911  just sayin
this is less about public safety and more about cc always using bc as the butt of a very bad joke
no
wait for the white jewish barnard girls to start complaining about people  having no chill
replace  white jewish  with  black  and see how it sounds
it was a fort
i wonder why the author felt the need to be mean about freshman building a fort  i hate frat guys also
why are people ignoring how this is a smaller keg in a big systematic machine that involves barnard always being looked down on  this is not just a funny joke this is serious stuff
but i think you mean cog
nah  frat thing
as a non sensationalist normal fucking journalist how can you publish something like this
how is this sensationalism  it s reporting news that s relevant to both columbia and barnard  get it together man
are you sure it was aepi  or any group specifically  or was that part mostly inflammatory
not creative   this is fucking hilarious  totally creative  take a step back and just laugh at this bwog
fucking hilarious and totally creative  at the cost of an entire student body s dignity
oh please  if a couple of fratboys goofing around in the middle of the night  cost an entire student body s dignity
bwog
is everybody here deficient in recognizing irony  these boys made a microchasm of barnard within barnard
it stops being funny when the joke is always about barnard
so make one back  if it s got ta be a practical joke rib em
barnard is overrepresented in the marching band you have no clue what you re talking about
was it not barnard that was protesting the hell out of orgo last year
perhaps it was not seriouslymeant  journey as we examine the evidence  there are
they were nt taking it seriously
seeing as the author you re kudoing does nt say the fratguys did the egging  in fact
all the people i know that were there said it was actually an observer that threw eggs at the fort  funny joke in my opinion
translation  get off my lawn you damn kids
seems like these incidents would nt happen if there were nt two schools  has anyone ever brought up the idea of merging barnard and cc
let s not open that can of worms again
let s not forget that this fraternity is nt just misogynistic
dear god i hope you re joking
if you think this is a joke
ah yes
your funny  i bet you brag that people find you funny  sheeesh  you re so funny
stop using zionist as a dogwhistle for jewish you antisemitic scum
lol at this because aepi has several nonheteros and even a trans man
this person is clearly a selfidentifying anti semite
everyone s complaining i m just here amazed that the author got this out so fast like damn how those journalists be journalisting am i right folks lol everyone calm down
yeah
how is this an angryrant post  stop complaining about everything
you should just know that back in the day
i ve seen people say this every year about every publication
no
everyone calm down
seems like the only people who really fucked up here were the residents of the quad who did nt turn this story into one about an elaborate counterhazing operation
really ladies  this feels like a group of 18 year old boys presenting themselves at your mercy and for your entertainment  you could nt find some fucking water balloons
ladies   fuck off
nah do nt downvote thisyou re right and i apologize
gentleman   i know
all female institutions like barnard are the last forms of separate but equal segregation policy
congrats on writing the dumbest piece of  anything
this is obviously a joke  and a hilarious one at that
been two weeks and still no coverage on no red tapes latest rapein  maybe that s why no one comments on your articles anymore
so
it s a squid  people eat squid  there have been salads with squid at john jay several times i ve been there  probably meant to be a part of this salad too  big fucking deal regardless
columbia is the worst
ankeet
i would nt mind taking that boy to a place where the sun also rises
this is lame af
now that enema sulkotitz and zoe  al sharpton  starr have left campus
that email was nt you all just fucking around
haha theft haha so funny
you columbia students are so lucky to have deborah eisenberg as an instructor here  she is the best writer currently working in the english language in my opinion  imaging having both henry james and virginia woolf at your school  that s the equivalent of what you have  i envy those who get to take her class
is it far too late to join   i m a total doof who went down the wrong rabbithole into underspecworld and now i need an out
come through
this is awesome  you guys should add him on facebook
is the first worthwhile thing bwog has posted this semester
well done bwog
old bwog
when are we going to start judging people on their merits rather than their skin color  why are we hiring people based on their skin color
funny how so many activist movements are obsessed with the idea of divestment  i guess people following a groupthink mentality do nt tend to be very original
why not actually build something and then invest in some cause
i wish these students would use their energy to find alternative sources of energy
cleo is a girl
did anyone see the notes from class of 2017 s last ccsc meeting  it was literally one sentence   it was a great week in 2017   whereas other years had things they were actually planning
it s so obvious the writer does nt understand the basic science at play here at all
these are the important stories
you misspelled genre
how many different  series  are happening  in general
crickets
this is a step in the right direction
literally what the fuck
is this a joke  is bwog joaquin phoenix  will this pain ever stop
yet another example of rampant rape culture on this campusthis video needs a trigger warning
what the butt
it s reddit
hahahahaha cuss needs that sense of humor   joincuss

the appointment is for the ccsc 17 rep

why would anyone want to celebrate the achievements of the man who did more than anyone else to bring western culture to this continent
columbus sailed in a small wooden boat with no gps across half the globe over five hundred years ago  what did the  indigenous  people do
what does a divestment protest have to do with indigenous people  is it that hard to click  new article
the divest chalk thing is nt related to the indigenous people s day events with nac  and that group of students is nt a protest
re  the comment climate change disproportionately affects indigenous people and by investing in fossil fuels
this is a mistake the divest picture is unrelated  it should be a separate post
that s not a  divestment protest
they have been fired   how many ras were cava d
gender neutral pronoun
certainly not a proper pronoun
funny commenter name is funny
i used singular they in the 13th century get over it
what the fuck is wrong with you
this post literally has zero news valueyou re all assholes  not that we did nt already know that
because the people like gossip
i do nt see a crown
bwog
all remaining respect for bwog
i submitted an actual good tip not this gossipy crap about the keys at lerner for your mailbox the replacements are now fifty four  54  dollars   instead of 13   post this tip the people deserve to know
is nt bwog supposed to be for the people by the people
not everyone gets cava d for alcoholdrug use
neither bwog nor spec should post student gossip  many people are ill for various reasons  this information should not be posted
i see you deleting comments so instead of deleting comments post the key tip
please pay no attention to the missing comments  look  spec backdatedan article

but they covered their bases by using  adviser  in the tags
is nt bwog student news  this is student news why is every one freaking out
how would you guys at bwog like it if every time one of you guys got cava d there was an article about it and for a period of time it talked about what floor you were on and what happened  there s no reason for this article to exist
its a big deal bc its an ra not a random dude  ras are supposed to set good examples for the ppl on their floors
i get that
bwog
it s one thing to publish an unnecessary
hi bwog you re a team of assholes and everyone on campus is starting to hate you  that s why you do nt even have the balls to publish the name of the writers  above   because you re assholes and everyone will rightfully hate you
i personally know three people working on the staff who were cavaed so do nt even start judging other people when you are a bunch of entitled
i mean
help iris from jj s ward off foreclosure
dude  bwog is so shitty now
it really is  wtf is this
some of these names are not at all informative
but free salads good too
are there any in fresno ca
what is this
roar lion roar    and wake the echoes of the hudson valley
this article leaves a somewhat bad taste in my mouth  i agreed with bwog s decision to stop running articles about the  f word  until the team and the athletic department got its shit together  it seems a little premature to publish an article after one win
they already announced they were changing their policy
true that  my bad
needs more gape culture
congratulations everyone
what about our record with respect to just ivy s  we can still keep it going
excellent win  this is a rebuilding process and they need our support  let s rally around our team  shouting her name forever  roar lion roar  for alma mater on the hudson shore
does anyone actually listen to these playlists
telling an  say  chinese student to go back to his own country is as stupid as telling a chinese tourist to leave the steakhouse and spend his money in the competing chinese restaurant across the street
each continent
just so you know
is it safe to assume the author and editor both attend columbia  there is a significant lack of accuracy on gary johnson s background  it is well documented that he summited the tallest mountain on each continent  quite embarrassing
bwog
this was written by the editor of your school paper  i think my jr high journalism teacher would ve asked for a complete rewrite
what a shite article
anonymous 846 pm the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the libertarian and green national committees
did you seriously end your article with a preposition  andy craig is an absolute idiot for linking me to this drivel
oh
marijuana legalization
great reminder of times when student s had loftier aims than their own advancement   continued police force was met with passionate picketing   educational institutions of higher learning are still a key platform for musicians to engage youth to make a lasting and effective points re  dire need for change in the world we live in  as long as students care enough to get involved
feminists just need to get fucked more
bwog used to be funny
i check bwog out of habit
there are just as many instances where men are discriminated against as there are for women  i would think white women are the most privileged in society
i do nt know if there are just as many instances
i find it interesting that the speaker did not conclude as a result of the fact that he identifies as a human first before anything else
that was informative
15   5 is because they posted on the senior night fb event that it was 5 beers for  5
it s literally just ccsc
why not rise up and try to stop crime
it certainly does not seem like a balanced panel  not that it would have to be  i think people have the right to hold imbalanced panels if they want to promote a certain point of view  but i also think it is more than a little bit absurd that the panelists seem to think and imply that policing just happens in order to victimize certain communities
it also is nt hard to come to the realization that besides the victims of police brutality whose names and narratives we generally do not hear of
columbia the greatest place in the world   selfcongratulation is indeed a rare quality in columbia and similar places
is that christina

we can get past the idea that we may be obnoxious to restaurant goers   are you sure  anyway
bwog
this makes no sense  is there supposed to be italics or something
how am i not in this story    it has all the classic elements of a nicholas cage movie1  it was written by a human2  it involves a conspiracy theory3  things are stoleni once stole the declaration of independence

im really tired of these playlist posts
hi  i am a barnard student who works with primary health care and well woman at barnard and students are absolutely not required to get flu shots  nor are any of those other people i m pretty sure
many colleges do require their students to get the flu shot  ironically most of the seven sisters require it  also all healthcare workers in new york state must get the flu shot
you are totally right  students are not mandated to receive flu shots  our writer for this post misinterpreted some information about the flu shotrelated events that columbia medical services are offering to columbia students this season  we have since updated the post to correct this oversight  thanks
i wonder how many students rushed off to get a shot thinking it was required  what a handy mistake for the vaccine pushers
i m serious bwog could do with this sort of thing
just so glad and so proud to see you here   3
teo armus is a little bitch
fuck this article
this is the first piece of actual news bwog has posted in ages  i ll keep reading if you let me know what s actually going on around campus
lol
this is funny  while i think russia has some historically legitimate claims to crimea and perhaps the situation in ukraine is more complicated than portrayed in the american media
and russia just bombed syria   putinthepeacemaker
wtf is a lenfest
does anyone know what s going on with mudd roof and why people are getting caught so much more often these days  what s changed  is there a new route that s safer
because we re technically not supposed to be up there one of the public safety guys told me their office is cracking down on the rooftops
great article
not the colbert report
you recalled for me the scene in almost famous where lester bangs  philip seymour hoffman  explains to william miller  patrick fugit   the only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when youre uncool your voice sounds refreshingly unscripted
such a lovely review to read
the b tattoo is very real  nothing to do with barnard
fashion commentary
bring back our dumplings
this seems really hostile toward new students for no good reason
this is honestly just mean
hi
what are  farm animals  and are they what i think they are
wow bwog
this is nt columbia student news though
nice to see the little women at barnard getting so involved  i always thought sga was the cutest
may i ask you to clarify what you mean when saying  little women
bangladesh is probably one of the worst countries in the world for human rights

hello there
you know pantone 292 is columbia blue right  you uncultured swine
i was nt aware when i originally wrote the post
i find it dishonest that as someone whose poster was featured on here
this was enjoyable and pretty well written
this is a really great piece
sad that someone had to lose a career because of sexual orientation  however
it is sad columbia is the only ivy that accepts vets
who took those delightful pictures  i would like to hire them for my next recipe book  butter

its the first time in nearly 50 years a pope is visiting the united states  pope benedict xvi visited the united states in 2008 and pope john paul ii visited the united states in 1979

where can u get bubble tea at  cafe 212  ferris booth  as in the first entry  neither of those two definitely seperate places have bubble tea lol
cafe east  we ve corrected the post
cafe east and tea magic are run by the some owner  tea is exactly the same
they are definitely not the same  the bubbles are tea magic are smaller and generally tastier than at cafe east  the tea is also better at tea magic  however
is going to 112 for tea magic really  leaving the barnardcolumbia bubble
there s that bubble tea place on broadway on 120th  121st  that is amazing
going to tea magic is  leaving the bubble  for the authors  what do you think 120th is
tea magic is horriblethe quality is constantly changing  sometimes it s good
i guess if you think about it
these people literally know nothing about bubble tea  this is neither funny nor accurate
culture tea bar on 121st and broadway is the best bubble tea around    it was worth the walk when i lived in cg
what is cg
for people who are interested in getting some good bubble tea outside the cubc bubble
cool beans
i luv dat movieeeee

as a fan of christina and of the legend of korra i deeply appreciate the reference to christina
phoebe newton should have written this article  she is currently my favorite bwog writer
well
oreos are not traditional bender food
thanks for the shoutout
it is such an honor to have an article already written about the legend of korra club  it is so much fun to find new people who enjoy this show as much as us
how was i not in this tv show      it has all the classic elements of a nick cage show  1  the main characters talk2  food is consumed as a source of nutrition3  it exists

i have done similar research on the topic of cafeteria line capacities and i find your results troubling  for the past 10 years i have conducted numerous studies on cafeteria lines and have found that only a maximum of 5 people can fit per step in a typical cafeteria setting  however i have never been to this  ferris  place
this was boring ass
off topic
not really
columbia has had pretty much every major world leader speak over the past few years  a lot has to do with scheduling and how long they are in new york
this is the 1st lawn party
this thing was twenty fucking dollars  what were they serving
this recipe makes me think of that bad n wordnutrition
what is stand up for science
hey  stand up for science is a proposal the acsri has been working on  to divest from fossil fuel companies for the reason that they fund climate change denial
fossil fuels are really important to the global economy and modern society  we all know the obvious uses for fossil fuels  gasoline and the like  but through the petrochemicals industry fossils fuels touch our daily life in more ways than you may realize  for example
any analysis of the benefits of fossil fuels can not be taken seriously without discussing the costs  no one is making the case that fossil fuels are not in the products we use on a daily basis
where does stipulation that 80  of carbon reserves stay in the ground come from  does this mean 80  of proven reserves at the moment or does it include probable reserves too  is the stipulation only for the us  i am trying to understand the demands of the group to see if i might want to sign on
80  is the proven reserves  reporting probable reserves would be pretty hard bc congress has a say
pretty sure the stipulation is for the whole world
the idea that 80  of proven fossil fuel reserves need to stay underground is based on data from an ipcc report that stipulated a  carbon budget  ie  the amount of co2 emissions the world  so not just the us  can collectively emit while still having a likely chance  50   of remaining below 2c of global warming beyond preindustrial levels
divestnow
the video though
good post  many people without an art background are too intimidated to walk into a gallery
i found your article to be entertaining and somewhat informative  although
amazing
what
that debate was way too long  a historical record  cnn
we do nt know the story but we do know the ending  donald trump will not be the next president
this was really good at the beginning then became and stayed good around number 9

i may be picking on someone with a condition where nuance is imperceptible

i got a kick out of the idea of asking to change rooms because  my roommate does nt support my drug habits   but seriously
posts like this are so dumb and juvenile
more content like this pls
this is a good post
at least 14 of them are fake  do better next time
thank god this art expert is here to educate us plebes

hi
is it not a shameful situation that students in a school that purportedly meets the full financial needs of its undergraduates
this is just like a program my sister has at uc santa barbara  swipes for us
last time i checked
so much screaming
a student wonders to himherself  if the school has decided to forswear capitalism
regarding the article about david cameron
not that i m disagreeing with the use of drone strikes against militants
i really do nt think it should be regarded as a big de at all  it is a killing of enemy operatives on the battlefield  were it in britain
no one reads bwog anymore  serves bwog right  there should be retribution for all the misandrist shit they post   dueprocess
seems like you might be right about the readership numbers  either bwog has fallen out of favor or the freshmen are using some form of communication that the rest of us do nt know about  like a new secret internet
with emma s graduated

i have a prezboner

wait what
does this mean that bc students also get free laundry
no
bc students will not get free laundry unless they live in columbia housing
what about detergent
do you see this bradley moot  do you see it  this is why we ca nt have nice things in jts housing  because this kind of details slips through the cracks
wow  this is great news for columbia students
by not making this video
just got my housing  harmony again  any tips on location info
move to a dorm closer to campus
bollinger might as well let everyone line up to fuck his wife  unreal
this comments section is so perplexing to me
but brownstones with free laundry already had higher rates to cover that  now they re being double charged
there is no charge for the now free laundry service  this is false misinformation from blog  the extra money was made from all the columbia summer programs and campus residents
nah the free laundry in the brownstones was always an accident
so then where do i have the id shipped to
read reviews for the vendor to see if the way they ship is discrete  for smaller orders
that s why it s ideal to get an id before you come to campus
harmony
you should probably pack the number of a good lawyer for the inevitable legal troubles you ll run into dealing with the sulkowicz types on this campus

barnard is not part of the ivy league
wishing you the best
that was a whole lot of words to say
sad to hear that someone who wanted to finish their education at an affiliated school had to prematurely end it  certainly if money is the concern it is especially sad
stop blaming barnard for your personal choices and your personal situations  you knew exactly barnard s costs and exactly your family situation going in  take responsibility instead of blaming  yeah
i never blamed barnard  i blame myself  as i express in what i ve written  and the education system wherein schools can charge thoughtlessly exorbitant rates  by your argument
i do nt know that the rates are thoughtless  probably the rates are determined at least in part by the costs associated with financing the annual expenditures of the institution  but the increasingly prevalent attitude expressed by mrms   porsche  is
how repulsive that one would compare education  a public good  to a shiny but intrinsically worthless luxury commodity  it is not an unusual attitude
taylor
where is mark lerner
amazing
the  horribly outdated video  is actually pretty good
will a poster attempting to educate students about consent and sexual violence be deconstructed and deemed not pc enough  grade 2 thinking at its finest
fucking no one finds this objectionable  bwog affiliates remind me of how south park depicts san francisco people  they are smug
or at least i hope you re being trolled
how do you do
come oooooonnnnn  are we really starting the year off like this  the slogan is cute and will start a conversation  every campaign needs an overhaul once in a while   consent is sexy  was nt doing it anymore  this is a smart upgrade
controversial to whom  a couple of students  i implore the nsop committee not to concede to these extremists
svr
just because you do nt agree does nt mean their extremists  also you identifying as a black person does nt validate or invalidate the opinions of other black people
consent is mandatory
shut the fuck up selfrighteous feminazi  you are not special and are not important
you will live a sad life and die alone
what they mean by  consent is a voluntary positive agreement  is that consent is voluntarily given by both participants  as in
bae
cum get it
maybe bae  is finally on the way out
using  bae  is not  appropriat  ing  african american vernacular english   dude what the hell literally everyone between the ages of 14 and 25 uses that word
it is appropriation
seriously  every single word in our language originated from somewhere else  we have greek
this article is absolutely awful  it comes off as a piece designed to be incendiary and reads as a tabloid  i love how the article is based on an anonymous  tipster  and the following statements are all based on the this  tipster s  feelings  how is this anonymous person representative of the entire campus   lol  also
another reason our school is going to shits
we can debate the efficacy of divestment as a whole but even if it does nt actually make a dent against private prisons
weed s gon na be legal everywhere soon and prison industry s gon na shrink immensely  great play getting our money out of there
but columbia university is itself a private prison  i m not a robot select all images of cookies

congratulations columbia prison divest     this is amazing
on march 31
sounds like a classy move on the part of bollinger  hopefully this will not invite an excessive politicization of investment decisions  everything in higher education seems to be politicized these days and it would be best that not everything were  but this seems like a most appropriate place to draw the line on profiteering
hey
i d really really love to see the columbia prison divest group commend this move  it would convince me that they re acting to improve the university and not just poke holes in its moral fabric
hope that everything in this matter is set right soon
what about putting fossils like ahmabolinguad in the prisons  is nt that like shilling two grant grubbing bidders with one scone
so he does nt like prison guard raping thugs but he does nt mind jonathan cole bragging about raping the families of undergrads
dorian warner  really
whatever happened with that grading fiasco
questions were asked and askers were asked to ask their questions   it s called organizing
thanks taylor  you re a great editor  enjoy your summer
i guess you guys missed all the discoveries
this is mainly a bitchy undergraduate publication for bitchy undergraduates
sulkowicz stole their thunder with her false victimhood  we live in ed up times
stupid  what does it mean to identify as a woman  wearing make up and dresses  if i do nt does it mean i am not a woman  come on  anyone can say they identify as a woman
if you choose to identify yourself as a woman  ie
by all means  if you re willing to live your life as a woman just to get a 20  shot at barnard admission
obviously
that was in response to  come on  anyone can say they identify as a woman   like
lol would that be like transtransgenderism  instead of being a trans woman in a male body
cool story bro
odds bwog will report on emma s porno
this is amazing  go barnard
this great for trans women who can now apply
this is awesome news  congratulations to barnard s board of trustees for being progressive leaders on this issue to promote inclusion in our community
one addendum  any reason that this is starting in 2016 and not 2015  i understand the need for an implementation plan but mt  holyoke already has it and it seems to be working well  not to say there should nt be work done on it but it seems like the turnaround could be quicker
it will start with admissions for the class of 2020
not so progressive  after all
ok is it just me or were there an abnormally few number of senior wisdoms this year  as cheesy ridiculous as this sounds
got ta keep them exclusive
they were all also pretty terrible this year
is bwog not covering commencement
everybody graduated
do nt bother coming back this time
pure and simple  she is a false accuser  just read all her messages  it s disgusting
thank you for this topic
bye chipotle
butts team   really  how objectifying
in the meantime
nice shoes
my interactions with her have been less than pleasant
have you considered that it could be because you re a fuckboy
im a fuckgirl
alex avvocato  how do i begin to explain alex avvocato  alex avvocato is  flawless  i hear her face is insured for  10
the articles in the spec oped section werent exclusively about wellness  im pretty sure that they were always about the white
considering that jews are 01  of the world and have tried to been exterminated for the last 2000 years
and considering they comprise 25   of columbia s student body despite making up only 2  of the us population shows you are grossly overrepresented their voice is on columbia s campus
new york has one of the largest populations of jewish people in the world
i do nt think that s what antisemitism is
oh shut up   like stop the jews are literally america s most privileged
yes
thats cause we worked hard for it
girl you are  1 forevernever carealways engage  by that i mean your 3rd thing learned is the greatest piece  s  of advice for everybody    ca nt wait to boogie this summer  3
you re a champion  best senior  wisdom   good luck and i m crashing you and svokos  boogie party  also
you re the best i ve never had
the senior wisdoms were lackluster this year
aviva
should nt it be a hard and fast rule to give senior wisdoms to all the senior class presidents
should nt it also be a hard and fast rule to actively solicit senior wisdoms from different subsets of campus so that you do nt end your senior year reading boring ass wisdoms from a group of mostly white boring ass people
our only hard and fast rule is to review all nominations
avv and spencyboo 4eva  3  3
i know
wooooo erik gray and eleanor johnson  3
this is so bad
why tho
natalie is by far one of the most genuine people at this school
this is so great
cannon s has nt been cannon s since 2006
should a news organization s pr director be dancing on stage with an israeli flag
natalie was hired as director of communications after bacchanal 2014
should a bwog commenter mind their own business
dude
i love natalie  3
nat you honestly do nt know the immense mark you ve left on this school and how greatly you ve touched everyone s lives  sosososo  blessed you re stayin in the city
huffpost live sucks
favorite class question
big fucking deal
fellow poli sci major  i also remember climbing the stairs to the top floor for all my stressful poli sci seminars and meetings with my thesis advisor  good memories
after taking 2 finals today and then coming back to my room and reading this
i must say
wow way to be mature about this u  adult
why does everyone hate columbia   i m looking at you too
there s nothing wrong with moving on to better paying jobs
there are several hopkinses  the earlier deans left for the university  it seems kasdin is going to the health system
when is ahmabolinugwad quiting
both former dean terry martinez and dean kevin shollenberger left columbia in the past years to accept positions at johns hopkins
and do nt forget robert lieberman

another rant by zoe
i remember when i once counted you as a friend  someone who supported me
lol i love that white dudes love railing against lynch mob  metaphorsstrawmen more than anyone else
ew
yuck  anti violence
is this satire
let s see how many of the comments come from people who are nt even on this campus  so far it s 3 out of 4  as someone who has actually had experience with zoe and does nt just see her as an abstract feminist redditangering shedevil
the overwhelming number of  non columbia  people who comment are generally alumni or parents  i think they have every right to comment  you are naive to think they do not read or do not care what goes on
or prefrosh who care about the state of our future school
or columbia students on offcampus wifi  that s me
and people who are abroad
frankly i do nt care about  let s see who s currently on campus and who s writing from lower east side and you should nt either  also
so many bitter as hell noncolumbia people gon na be commenting on this one  i do nt have strong feelings about her personally
noncolumbia people do nt read bwog  it s not something everyone knows about
zoe sucksssss
i do nt know you
do nt let the door hit you on the way out
zoe is an absolute bad ass and this is genuinely great advice  especially about the cheese  valso
does anyone at this school have a sense of humor

hahaha bwog please favorite this
if you have ever felt personally victimized by zoe ridolfistarr
as someone who considers zoe a good friend
how is literally any of this misogynist  you are truly delusional  saying she order dumplings while someone was eating her pussy is not misandrist but calling zoe out for being a terrible and manipulative person is
uhm
her sexual orientationgeneral misogyny are nt reasons for the negative comments  i m a feminist who used to really admire the work that she does  until i saw how she used her power to harass and trigger friends of mine who are survivors of sexual assault  and based on the rest of these comments
i was replying to the dude who said the dumplings comment was misandry  i was making the point that the person giving her oral could have been a woman since zoe is bi  understand now
finenow explain to me
that just means that whoever was going down on her was bad at oral sex  how is that misandrist
misogyny  disagreeing with or criticizing zoeidentifying with rapists  criticizing the characterization of a student  who was found  not responsible  by the school  as a rapistso much logical fallacy
surprised by how much i enjoyed her advice section
zoe s awesome and does nt need any of you  keep on keeping on  do nt let these kids bring you down
go back to your village
got free emergency contraception provided at health services
lolololol right there
why should nt she tell people about an amazing contribution like that
one of the speeches she gave at a university senate meeting about the rules of protest very heavily implied
anyone know what happened to emma s mysteriously vanished sw from this morning
lol at bwog taking down emma sulkowicz s senior wisdom
they took it down because she was receiving death threats  not sure  lol  is the right word
lol
did they follow through  lol
and when paul received death threats
her comment about getting eaten out will follow her on the internet forever  foolish and irresponsible  maybe she does nt ever want to be employed
no surprise she is unemployed  and probably will remain so
wait what allegations were made against zoe  also
bwog will delete if anyone says but if you read between the lines of the comments
sorry but you really need a reality check  you re not some kind of feminist hero
i did nt recognize her at all from this picture
i thought to inform you that i had listened to several interviews that you have been in regarding claims of rape and i learned something  you lied  i m not going to convey how i figured out that you lied via your interviews
do you not keep a guide to etiquette next to your thesaurus
while i also have many issues with zoe
ca nt tell if satire  if not  lolololololol  zoe s not my favorite either
she has never personally wronged me at all  is nt it fun to feel so passionately about things that have no effect on your life
bwog you got rid of the troll misandry comment  now the people replying to it look like we re just replying to zoe
what s wrong with labeling a misandrist a misandrist
there are a lot of comments on this article that are attempts to discredit the antisexual violence movement and smear survivors through ad hominem attacks against zoe  i do not believe this is one of them  i have personally interacted with zoe a great deal as a fellow antisexual violence activist
i am so sorry this happened to you  nobody deserves that
you need to stop deleting comments
i have no clue if this is legit or not  regardless
zoe is in many ways a wonderful person and in others one of the scariest people i ve met  although it seems relatively clear to me that the overall impact of her extremist
omg that s so true tho
dear nrt members
thank you for continuing to repost  it s really incredible they keep deleting your comment
zoe
you truly are the greatest lover at barnard
aviva is a goddess
viv
i was in reacting with aviva my first year and that girl is definitely going places  emperor for lyfe  love you viv  3
truly one of the greatest people i have met at this school  you are so loved
on the 1st day of a class about memory and trauma and you joked about how wrong it was you had brought a glittered out flower power notepad to write ingod you bring so much joy to peoples  lives
a true god among men
women
and she s a mock trial star
this is everything a senior wisdom should be
that part about barnard is everything  aviva is such a special person
aviva is jesus  like people reading might think im kidding but she literally is the lord and savior she will bring us to salvation at judgement day you will find yourself kneeling before her keep this all in the back of your mind we are mere peasants
aviva
this is spectacular
thank you for your radiant
i worship aviva and this has me tearin
once again
in a total reversal of roles
another senior wisdom without any wisdom  on a roll this year
i mean these are pretty solid class recommendations
since when has bwog trolled anybody
or are you a freshman
the only wisdom she has is how to ruin a mans life for sport
liar
i love how bwog is deleting all the negative commentsyou guys are honestly patheticstop the censorship retards
she lied
you know
how can she be  cool  if you know  and do nt agree with  what she s done  logic
a promise  your student
if you do not  agree with what she has done
that blue hair is sexy af
it s back yo
dis gon be gud
rip comment section
emma
if she s your role model
disguise is as thin
is osama bin laden also on your top ten list
adp was never cool
what semester did you rush
awesome form of masturbation  how very classy
lol clicked  track  embarrassing that you ve commented on this four times under different usernames
i do nt have different user names
as a tissue  if
thank god for the track button
you can track me again  it will make your life more meaningful
you go away well
promise to miss you
wtf are these incoherent comments
wait just realized if you track that person they make a sentence   a promise  your student disguise  is as thin as a tissue  if you go away we ll promise to miss you   and they re all in response to that one pathetic offcampus person that keeps commenting lol
the opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists  indeed
so rosalyn deutsche is to blame
bush did 911
try spelling her name right lol
extra c for cheney
your lawyer would have noted that you had no evidence to launch an investigation
what semester was text magic performance last offered  who was the prof
i love how bwog is deleting all the negative commentsyou guys are honestly pathetic
why are all of these senior wisdoms from activists  there are plenty of people at this school who are not activists  why did this person get one over me
were you nominated
claim to fame  none   lol

where s paul s senior wisdom
you have the support of lots of people here  best to you emma
do you also support child murder
emma wo nt get a real job in nyc because her hipster visual arts major only qualified her to carry mattresses around  good thing she found feminism so she ll be able to blame the patriarchy instead of the fact she picked a shitty major
is this the one who carries a bed across campus
so
lol good one  not if you re a guy
so
it is enough that you re a woman and you disguise your harassment as  art   those group thinkers and your cowardly school would not dare to contradict you
i believe the rest of your life will be marked by your stunt in a negative
how can she live with herself
we ll see what s next
george bush does nt care about black people
why is everyone so angry when exactly no one  besides a couple of people  know all of the facts  we are supposed to be thinkers  right
we know enough to accuse sulkowicz of false rape allegations  period
dont let the drivel of ignorant mysogenists get you down
you are absolutely fucking crazy  she lied
we ran a pearson s correlation that showed a significant relationship  r  9
the thing that s dirty and wrong
literally two exclamation points in the comments
congratulations
i only know a few on this list
hey bwog what happened to emma s senior wisdom                                                           asking for a friend
love you
where did emma s senior wisdom go
i ve been wondering the same thing  what happened to it
lol cmon guys what do you think
class of 2015 does nt deserve the worse batch of senior wisdom interviews  there are more qualified people out there
these senior wisdoms stink  and why are they all barnard
julia  was that picture taken in nepal
would you rather give up oral sex or cheese  i dont like cheese except for on pizza  so definitely oral sex  mama loves that diana pizza   what
is street corner kevin a drug dealer
no
not sleeping is very bad advice  please
why are all the senior wisdoms barnard
none of them are wise
what about seas
go molly
back in my day   cole hickman had no hair  hahahahaha omg omg omg
molly
bwog why
that was great  and you know it s all true
in the prohibitionist s world
speaking of morals and sins
the  war on marijuana  has been a complete and utter failure  it is the largest component of the broader yet equally unsuccessful  war on drugs  that has cost our country over a trillion dollarsinstead of the united states wasting billions upon billions more of our tax dollars fighting a never ending  war on marijuana
i dont understand why this supposed to be funny
bwog is really terrible this semester
this might work on spectrum
sad truth  google ruined trivia contests
i forgot about it
such a bad review
you re extraordinary
and all the boys proceed to fap at that bod
is the greatest  this community will not be the same when she graduates
i wuv u
ugh you rule orli
i fucking love orli
talking to your mom and masturbating are probably two things everyone should do and not necessarily consider extracurricular activities
i d never heard about the professor affair with his daughter until reading this  ty for the hours i will now spend googling this
you did more than get crunk at that party
orli is not just the shit
amazing
best oral sex or cheese answer
go carly
can someone explain how radio is killing music
sejal is definitely a divisive personality on campus
imagine a world in which all of the people who wasted even a second of their lives having anything bad to say about sejal instead devoted that second to doing the type of amazing work that sejal does  it s a world i would prefer to live in
this though
would you rather give up oral sex or cheese  well
wonder if sameer mishra is going to get the reference
when was commencement canceled for a hurricane  do you mean convocation
wtf did you chip a tooth on though
ask sameer mishra
best response to oral sex or cheeseeverwoooooo
sejal  3
she seems awesome  but bwog the formatting of these with the new layout is horrible plz fix
there are sexist assholes at columbia  and everywhere else  and they may try to tear you down  dont ever let that intimidate you or stop you from speaking up
i dont know how you define  scruples
i do nt want to derail the comments on a senior wisdom   3 sejal  honestly find it so endearing that she d spend paragraphs in her senior wisdom breaking down campus resources
you do nt even go here
i had sejal in one of my seminar classes this semester  i never really talked to her
why is nt this about me
to make an already mildly funny performance absolutely boring
administration s war on fun  how about the sulkowiczzoe group and their  rape culture  nonsense and false accusations  do nt you think that the administration s  war on fun  was a response to the activists relentless bullying
you do nt even go here
the war on fun started in 2006
to be clear
and neither do you
i liked the transcript better
ms sulkowicz
was gon na come call you out as well
i ve paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for two of the  crowns  that you re bragging about  i m a parent and i am very invested in what s going on at columbia  very much so  my daughter graduated in 2010 and my son is currently sophomore  my wife is an alumna and we re thinking about sending our youngest child to columbia
let me guess  le reddit army
mlady  maybe you should get a fedora next to your name in the absence of a crown
fedora  you have something against me because i m jewish
if i was antisemitic i would have suggested a yarmulke

had intro to ir with this guy and also saw columbia kingsmen s performance  never got to know him but thought he was nice and talented  great postgrad plan btw
literally the best human ever
doug is a wonderful human being  i am so happy to see him accomplish his dreams
the future of orgo night has nothing to do with sga  wait your turn
it looks like sga will in fact have to grapple with orgo night  why  that s not your job  eat your ice cream at 12 am  enjoy
lol
flashes back to chris crockerleave orgo night alone
wait they just want to shut it down because someone might get offended next time  i thought we were all charlie or something
many members seemed torn on the subject
i am so happy that barnard is finally taking action against orgo night
dpsarbarnard admins sure made a lot of missteps this year
what you think of comments right now
from christopher conlon in intro to econometrics  the reason there are no review sessions for the final is that the tas are on strike
yes bb
love ya boo
i didnt start to meet my people until october of my sophomore year  im still meeting more and more people  your people might be in unexpected places
is arguably the best yet   thank you for so much of the work you have done on campus  3
one of us  one of us
fuck you
that you find contentment and happiness soon  sounds like you need it
thanks bwog for deleting the comment this was in response to  like sincerely
what is the rationale behind not building it to be very tall
a lot of people on claremont ave  cu faculty  were not happy with a building as tall as altschul blocking the sunview  i m guessing that s why the tower is only partial
once again old white men from columbia ruin things for barnard  half those people pay almost nothing for their housing
so the whole purpose of tearing down the old thing and making a new one is space  and yet other than the addition of that tower it does nt look that much bigger
for class of 2017 we get to go through the whole building process and wo nt even be there when it opens
cry me a river  for class of 09
there are nt any gaps between the new building and either barnard hall or altschul  that will take some getting used to
proud to be the first to say  ewww
this is different
i like it
hershmaaaaaann
it looks like a dog farted and vomit came out instead
spec sucksi am a robot and i can beat the capcha suggit speck
after 4 years this is so strange
look like barnard s redesigned page  in general what s the purpose of changing appearance if the contents are mostly the same
it looks like you can upvotedownvote the same comment multiple times
turns out you can
i really wish i had refreshed the page before upvoting this comment 1000 times
honestly the more i look at it the less i hate it  i think the side bars should be smaller  and so should the text that says 9 comments  but for the most part  i like it
on the main page
i still miss old bwog
do nt make sense anymore because it now inserts  says  after the name  it should go the way of the  is  that used to precede facebook statuses back in the day  does anyone here actually remember early facebook
i do i do
on a 13  screen the content  middle column  is hilariously small  responsivity is great
ugh
i like it but it seems really cramped and narrow towards the middle  kind of annoying
this is super shitty  also now super bad on mobile devices bc you have to scroll through soo much to get to any articles
sooooooo true
it s not awfulhowever the design needs some serious work for phones and normal laptop screens  soooo much wasted space and scrolling hides the content
tickets for bacchanal will be fee   freudian slip
no
and please
but who is this person
wait ben where are u working in seattle
i m working in kirkland
ugh i wan na live with you you sound great

i ate him
thanks for the wisdom
ben i love you
best wisdoms yet  it s the laughter you will remember
ben is my personal hero and we will exchange clickhole jokes for the rest of eternity
almost all of the relationships in the show are heteronormative
there s literally one romantic relationship in the show lol
the varsity show was great if you like lighting design that looks like it was done by a blind man
really  do nt be a heterophobe
i like the idea of nonresolution in the ending
is actually the coolest
umm cole was amazing
yea he a beast
saturday s sound quality was absolutely awful  whoever had the job should be fired and should never work in the industry again  could nt hear like 20  of the lines because of their shitty job
omg  have you ever seen a show in roone before  sound in there is ridiculously bad always  this one sounded comparatively good
no  i was sitting right behind the sound guy  he was just forgetting to turn the mics on  i could see when he would realize he forgot and watch his hand turn it on  it had nothing to do with the room
this also happened friday  entire lines were nt amplified
the show s not as perfect as you make it out  the show manages to marginalize nearly everyone on this campus
lol it s the varsity show  it s supposed to exaggerate and satirize everything  that s literally it s only job   the show needs to get off its high horse  it does not know best   of course  it  does nt   it  is the varsity show
this show was not tailored to the tastes of people who are happy and comfortable with the way things are now
this is the most talented cast that the varsity show has ever seen  yes
u clearly did nt see v118 that had such a better main cast
also she s previously played mama rose in gypsy and this role seemed to channel a lot of the same qualities
first time seeing the show as a junior and i was highly impressed  well done everyone  made me proud to be a columbian again

this is the weirdest review  it s like a cc class postthe show was three hours long
better than v119
that representation of goldberg was spot on
paulina was awesome
skylar gottlieb was by far the best part  the rest was merely eh
overall
stop feeding st a s ago  although honestly mckay
got ta eat the booty like groceriesss
like if you googled hari nef after reading this
hari opted not to go long
hari is very good at what she does
can we stop using senior wisdom s as places to tear down our peers  senior wisdoms are a place for us to celebrate people who ve done cool work and to pass on advice to younger generations  they re one of very few positive
yes it did
you know you can turn down a senior wisdom
right  like she seems like a really interesting person
wow
i m not surprised by these comments  either hari is nt into creating a platform for the right reasons  in reply  read any interview hari has given
but she s a social climber
how
queen
fuck right off hari
funny that people think that shading hari on bwog will in any way affect her resplendent brilliance  you re a fucking legend hair      hope you had a good senior yr  d
obvi meant hari  not hair

i have a 392 and i did nt get it
there are a fair number of people close to and over 40
that s my boyfriend
mine too
same guy  uh oh
calm down
is anyone else bothered that this is alphabetized by first name
congrats
onion and couchllama
wow
mark lerner
emma sulkowicz
this is great
in her credentials she left out the most important decision of her career at spectogether with steven lau she decided to publish nungesser s name because emma and her fanatic friends from nrt said so  congratulations  two people s lives  emma s and paul s  are ruined because spec was hungry for the clicks  there lies a splendid career ahead of her
because a police report was filed with nungesser s name  that became public information at the police office  it was way more than  because emma and nrt said so   do you even go here
have fun getting the  special edition  nightly from michael ouimette postgrad  as if we all do nt know about that
such a good post  enjoy the corrupt dicking
great senior wisdom    congrats
abby
you nacoms really ca nt resist any opportunities for transparent selfcongratulations
she seems like a nice person
no offense
he still could have gotten the job  all the situation required was a recusal and acknowledgement of conflict of interest  it happens all the time  it s an ethical baseline
i hope this does nt set the tone for entirely undeserving people getting senior wisdoms this year  except that i m almost 99  sure it does  and if i m wrong
to the contrary
she affected huge change at spectator  in the worst way  most people who have had to work with her or for her do nt like her
i doubt you re actually a speccie
affected change   unseemly discernment
too concerning
i think i d have enjoyed columbia more if i d spent more time  just hanging out and coasting through classes  and less time trying hard at achieving temporary campus relevancebut hey
truth  you have the rest of your life to work on your careerpassions  college is the last time you ll be able to just sit around on weekdays shooting the breeze with your buddies  looking back
should be  should you read the articles

yaaaaaasssssss
i m such a fan
i ve been wondering about all the googly eyes   my fave was when he put them on the barnard athena statue s nips  they got removed pretty quickly though

this is a sexist article
on april 1st 2015
he s in st a s  same effective meaning
delta psi
singh and porter both discussed the problem that ccsc hasnt been vocal on womens issues like reproductive issues  when it comes to those issues
they ca nt do anything without general body buy in and at least in the past no one was ever interested in doing anything related to gender
mabruk
thank you
the women are all out protesting
columbia women are too smart to waste their time squabbling over useless student council positions
the last section sums it up great  women  and
ironic that mariam wrote this article but she is now chair of sgb
normative assumptions about religion do nt suit me  spirituality can not be contained in taxonomies
hillelaryeh pls
this is such a stupid ad hominem  you re blaming mariam for the sgb electorate s decision

during an exchange jokingly discussing how singhs tooth was chipped
what do you imagine that guys say about other guys  it s kind of the same stuff  actually
so boys will be boys and women must assimilate to that culture since it s the one in control  is that what you re saying  just because it s a  centerpiece of male interaction  that does nt mean that it s automatically right
right  what the fuck are you talking about  the point is that it s not sexist
did nt say ccsc does nt have sexist assholes

also did you even read the article  it literally says that this is nt necessarily a historic trend
the fact that it s claimed as a trend is a problem  two years is two data points
rich
those comments violate bwog s comment policy
we  3 u
sejal singh is a campus leader who has fought for student safety
nepal is nt a city
thanks for point that out  i never learned world geography in high school
9 can not be coco
i mean noco
100  agree on thatalso i should go study
i m 50  sure that s not the only wrong one
i got one right
the correct  answers to most of these are blatantly wrong
activism by  selfidentified gay men  is worthlessif bwog wants to report about gay activism
this was nt bad
and enlightening  tnx barnard dad
not once has she said she wished she applied to columbia  she really loves this college   who is this trying to convince
back in the day
traditionalism  wtf
this was obviously written by a barnard student and not a dad

you caught me  i am a barnard student  however
not once has she said she wished she applied to columbia  she really loves this college   lol bitch
i saw a guy reading this article  he really seemed to like it  guess i do
what about gs students
gs students do nt live in the dorms  cc and seas are giving acccess to their own students to their own dorms
i do nt think you understand what student life fees pay for and how access to these things works  these fees are paid by gs
i actually agree with  gsjts   they pay student life fees as well
wow just in time
this line up is unbelievably good  please be respectful of the almighty rock n roll
did yall land perfect pussy
how does one get a sarcasmfree promotion on bwog before their event like this
john jay is the dorm to choose  a double is annoying though because you have to walk through room 1 to get to room 2 complications arisejj single is the way to go
is a steel mine
if your racist arrogance is so petty that you feel the need to report workers for speaking spanish
it s not racist to expect that workers speak a language that 100  of columbia students understand  disallowing the spanish language in the workplace is not the same as disallowing hispanics in the workplace  real racism
1  i believe this refers to the workers speaking spanish to each other
i do nt think it s right
englishonly on the workplace policies are often recognized as discriminatory violations of labor law per the eeoc
what s  a hispanic   is that like  a black   the term hispanic refers to spanishspeaking people or culture and does not relate to race  so your comment is not only factually incorrect  anon
that staff ca nt speak a language common to them between each other is honestly ridiculous  and nine times out of ten
why do these students listen to workers complaints more than fellow students
having employees eat and take breaks in a break room is a normal thing to do at any service job  however
leave dining alone  it s a service oriented business and i think it s a lot like disney world  you would nt want the cast members breaking out of character to talk among themselves
this is a troll comment
i dunno bruh i d rather the people handling my food understood each other as well as possible
if we are going to start banning languages
this is no surprise  dunn has been on everyones radar for a while for being discriminatory  when i read this
can dudes host propsie girls
i do nt think so
this is really creepy
i do nt think it s okay for this person to take any action  even in the best of circumstances  this propie is also into you  you re gon na need to do some kind of hitting on  flirting  being straight up about it  that prospie is counting on you for a place to stay
thank god  about time
go away
so before this i was thinking that emma just hated getting that stick in her stink  but now it turns out homegirl is a freak begging for that crap cutter to get stretched  i m trying to get a poll going on here
atemma
stop it
in case if anyone s interested in reading the whole thing
share the shit out of this
i love how bwog is cited in a footnote  so legit
hahaha this shit is hilarious    on december 16
hey
emma to paul   fuck me in the butt  read the document  amazing and appalling what she put this poor guy through  real life gone girl
she messaged paul that she had testedpositive for an std after having had sex at a party  with both john doe and his best friend joe
emma also messaged paul frequently throughout that summer with messagesincluding   wuv youuuu
emma does ass to mouth  3on august 21
basstomouth or asstotrout
just when i finally thought that this story had come to a close
her lies have been finally exposedif you read the court document
yo wtf are these comments  she joked about that a full year before the alleged incident occurred  do you really think that joke legitimizes what happened  seriously  and of what relevance is it that she got an std from anyone  are you implying that having an std
no
she was nt just  joking  about anal sex a year before  how do i know  because emma and paul actually had anal sex before the  rape incident  because emma asked for it  they simply had anal sex again
i know the feeling bro
i do nt think he s your bro  you ve harassed him enough
yeah
chill out everyone  her comment is fucking hilarious  take a joke
do nt blame him this shit has gone on without proof for so long that i ca nt imagine it ending with anything other than a win for him
some justice
sulkowicz and nungesser should duel to the death on low plaza to the tune of this gem
always go with the v
the accusations  especially of emotional abuse  seem farfetched  it seems to me that these girls
cool story
there is a  track  button
sssshhhhhjust let him have it  he s trying so hard
read between the lines
she harassed and bullied him  his future is ruined  and you re saying this is about the mattress and graduation
yes  that and fear of retaliation  on track to graduate
who cares about being at the actual graduation  i would be surprised that he would really care about being there on the day of graduation  especially after the school and many of his peers
emma
yo this was paul
yeah
is she really  time to get over herself
atemma loves the attention  and she also loves that nasty taste
i hope he sues emma
court document
her lies and deception are finally uncovered
the court document
haha
of the court document  you ll never think about this story the same way ever again  why do nt bwog and spec publish those pages  wait
and it makes a compelling case that columbia has enabled and implicitly supported harassment of paul nungesser  some favorite quotes that you should read   columbia initially told the activists it would cost  1
there is a principle in antidiscrimination law called  disparate impact   if a particular law or process can have a disparate impact on people of a protected class  and sex is a protected class  then that constitutes discrimination  paul has to prove that columbia not acting to protect students accused of sexual assault is have a larger negative impact on males than on females
read the facebook messages emma sent paul  honestly if paul needs money for his legal fund i will be more than happy to conribute and start a kickstarter  he should sue her for defamation
yaaas drag ha
blessed that i m male and gay
privileged to be gay
harvard may have amy dunne but we have emma    proudalum
you got ta give columbia some credit  they did nt cow tail into sulkowicz  claims  they stood firm behind the facts and stood behind their decision to not discipline nungesser  good for them  on the other hand
this lawsuit shows how text poorly corresponds to how people emotionally feel in the physical world and visaversa
my takeaway from the theatrics and uproar surrounding this incident is how quickly peoplemobs can flip 180when the case came out
you would like to think it s  theatrics  because you re probably not affected by this whole campus rape hysteria in any way  many people are  many people know someone who is falsely accused or raped  the problem is how we interpret the information we find and how we react to what we find  having a conversation is important  having a conversation online like this is important
the university and emma s actions are heinous  paul
this is the first story related to genderbased misconduct that the spec has nt placed on page 1 talk about bias  thanks to the bwog for real coverage  shame on spec for promoting an agenda rooted in baselessness
you know what s disgusting  that spec
bwog  this is more important than any other feeble piece of  news  you will publish today  so why do nt you dig deeper into the court document to at least demonstrate the critical
sulkowicz is the reason that real victims have to be asked uncomfortable questions and have their stories scrutinized  she has done more to hurt real victims than than any failure of columbia ever has
any victim has to be asked many questions and many uncomfortable questions  always  not because of emma s it s hard on them but it has to be done  how else would we distinguish between mob justice
well yea
i agree
i d like to thank bwog for reporting
have you clowns turned off new comments
lol at spec s complete silence on this matter while having published 10 million articles sucking up to our national hero emma
yeah emma really sounds like a trustworthy person with a normal
shows some very aggressive commenting by the same person
yes
at graduation
emma lied

please do nt post more comments  we get it
please do nt shush people  if you read the court files  i encourage all to read at least first couple of pages  and see the actual transcriptions of emma s and paul s words
shut the f   k up  do nt tell me what to fucking do
all of you who believed emma s lies all along
so pleased that all these graduate students get so much teaching experience
i have to say
we ve got a humanist with stellar academic standing in our midst
my father is a tenured professor at a large and respected research institution and he often reads the texts for the first time as he is teaching the class  part of the job description for being an academic is that you should be able to read a text quickly and be able to extract teachable information relatively quickly
interviewing your brotherinlaw without disclosing the relationship  now that s some fine journalism right there
this is bullshit  this just shows how much of columbia s reputation is built upon the fact that it has been lingering around for a long time
some tenured faculty are terrible teachers  some grad students are the best you ll ever have  fortunately
the price to be in a multiple next year is  8
we miss you
why is bwog so barnardcentric
this is awful
mandatory link in any discussion of carman
some people choose to move all four beds in the suite into one room and then have the other room to hang out inpartywhatever
needs more hubbard obrien  and for netflix to be openly playing on their unwatched laptop screen
between riverside and crazy   wish i had thought of that
according to the website
who the fuck is running bwog these days
spec sucks
could nt agree more
well
makes sense this was written on 420  i can smell the author s weed through my computer screen  strangest thing i ve read all day
nice maymay
you know
who cares
i have been looking for this video since u guys posted it last ear
none of what you said makes sense but okay this is funny
yeah
wow barnyard was still full of animals back in the day
columbia engineering school invented a camera that never needs charging
lara and phil killed it in this video  they look so believable as a couple
is nt lara dating zane
3 adil habib  3
1020 stamp at 200 typical lara
lerner broke ground in 96
i feel like such a millennial idiot for asking this
in answer to anonymous above
who is the old chick who played the old chick
i thought lerner was named after mark lerner
is nt in this video and that makes me sad
this one s pretty weak  where s mark lerner
i love the cast and cuss
they dont even take calculus xy credit at columbia
anyone know if that lara girl is single  i see a lot of people joking on here but i would love to hide my snake in her bush
adil
tl  dr  people disagree with what i think is important to focus on  comments on the event i heard were either detrimentally ignorant
not enough people were involved but the hundreds who participated were too white
extend dropin hours to midnight and into weekends  this this this
there should be liaisons between so many departments at columbia
like a proper columbia student
imma let you finish
why is there no male representation here
go shiv
readings from cervantess don quixote and montaignes essays are to be reduced
still no sappho
only one of her complete poems has survived  please tell me how that and fragments of a few other poems are substantial enough to be put in the syllabus
i would wait and see re  sappho
how can they remove faust  not only one of the best written
white guys
sorry that white guys have contributed the most to literature art and science throughout history  the only other group that has contributed non negligible amounts to these subjects are arabs
i really hope you re a troll  there s an argument that can be made for lit hum s syllabus s exclusiveness
please tell me about all the great non whitearab empires throughout history
there are tons
do nt troll so hard
in response to the ignoramus cc16 of course
alphabetical language propagates chiefly from the activities of people with physical histories away from central
ok but like who is the harmony hunter
clearly a firstyear
how could you remove job
i ve made a huge mistake
how can they gut the course like this  what purpose does it serve to cut medea
i like this decision  the tempest lends itself very well to introduce postcolonial
tempest is incredible
this is ridiculous
moving up the aeneid is fantastic  the rest
professor jennings  donald sutherland   now  what can we say of john milton s  paradise lost   well
really bad idea to teach genesis after odysseythere is a reason that you go odyssey
removing medea and lear
will they add hunger games
i have a feeling this is not based on the survey they asked everyone to take at the end of the year  because i m pretty sure at least everyone in my class liked medea
i do nt really care for job
may as well go to yale
but what about the magnolia tree during construction
so the library is going to be expanded to accommodate the addition of a dance floor
so
i ca nt say anything about a gym or a pool
barnard is an anachronism  a mediocre school that has a parasitic relationship with columbia university  how about those bold beautiful columbia college women  anyway
i feel like dean awn might have a cat
dean kromm keeps a cat
hallie nell is supreme
it is amazing how ignorant bwog and spec staff s are with resect to columbia s other schools  oz has been on columbia s staff for over twenty years
rule 1 prevent nrt from constantly harassing and terrorizing students and interupting school events  rule 2 keep students
based on the twitter transcripts from both spec and bwog
amazing
i am in a glass cage of emotion
what a hottie
this is incredible
shoutouts that youngboy dagan brown   truly inspirational
ok but holy shit mark lerner singz tooo      marklernerforprez  marklernerthemusical
it s more than good   it s great
you should be guillotined for how bad that video was  i m done with hearing the people sing
look at that dagan brown    truly an amazing performance as always     the emotion     too much to handle honestly  perfect delivery
a triumph
the best thing i have seen bwog produce in my 4 years at columbia  amen
not enough adil habib in this
reveal yourself imposter
yo
just when you thought these videos ca nt get any worse  this one literally gave me swine flu
it s so obvious all the people in this wannabe glee club wrote the first 10 or so comments
omg les miserables was like my favorite musical of all time  then i saw this piece of crap and i was like  you literally ruined my day
instead of no red tape projecting on low
the production quality of this video was superb
uses the same  worse than a th grader  line twice in two lines
haters pls leave
brought to you by the fuckboys of sig nu
is mark lerner gay  bc i m down
weird how i got 11 thumbs up but no response
this is so messy tbh
writing praseworthy comments about yourself is nt going to make this wretched show any better at all
eliana pipes
is a comment
have you ever been to the zlovin shows down by the docks  this is very much like those  as the children gather by the hearths the elder men crawl slowly on hands and knees toward the boats  when all the men have gathered the drakuna steps from behind the curtain  she is a she but also a he  the feathers that make up her headdress scare the small men as they shrink further toward the ground  sometimes the tale she tells gives the men inspiration
if you could throwup onto film tape
better than the movie tbh
i do nt know what to do with this
to your inner goddess
100x better than the new kink imho for a few reasons  1  doesnt take itself seriously and 2  its gay
loved the ambiguity of the narrator s gender
what is happening
mark lerner will you be my halal guy
poopalso no one gaf about the music m8
hi friend

where can we see floor plans for the singles left in river and broadway
the gs senator s name is katharine celentano
second week in a row it s been misspelled
and on this day
i love elliott so much  there is more of a sense of community than at most other dorms  the singles are so cozy  no dealing with having to clean your own bathroom or waiting for someone to be done with the shower in a suite  elliott is so underrated  i second that not helliott tag
they will do something stupid
huh  housing already provides students with online access to the new york times for free
hi bwog
is this
i got god is dead
i do nt remember kimmy schmidt being this angry
what s wrong with wearing heels
there s cockroaches doe
lol the good half of 620 was already gone when this was published
no bacchanal

senator studies our habits as consumers and uses those observations to counsel companies on how to night barnard sga
here we go
it in my soul
a better headline  students project their own uselessness onto columbia
hi  still trolling  bwog
what is the purpose of the protest   i understood the point last year but this is making no sense to me anymore  why are they continuing this year
abuse
but what specifically are they looking to see happen  is this a general protest  because it honestly feels like it to the average columbia student who is not involved in nrt  are they protesting against something specific  do nt say oh they protect rapists and rape happens on campus because that s not showing anyone what the point of all of this is
the idea is to put pressure on the administration by protesting when prospies are around  one of the big reasons for why university administrations are so eager to fudge rape statistics is because if a parent decides to look that sort of thing up
i feel like i m talking to sarah palin or something because you really did nt answer the question  specifically what is the issue at hand  fudging statistics where  in what reports  what is the goal of this entire movement  because this whole thing seems like continued protestations for no significant change  the majority is no longer on the side of nrt because somehow the organization failed to communicate its goals and honestly looks like a bunch of people making noise for no damn reason
you re talking nonsense  you have been brainwashed  where are the proofs for any of what you re claiming  wake up people
yeah
thank you for saying that  i ve been diagnosed with ptsd due to sexual assault and i ca nt stand how every single time i turn around i have to see the words rape and assault  does anyone see the irony in this  i have gone into panic attacks at being inundated with literally countless triggers  thanks so much nrt  really appreciate it  i ve gotten to the point of disliking mattresses
that s how i felt when nrt ambushed my campus tour last year  they had no trigger warning when they shoved fliers about rape and sexual assault into the faces of the mostly junior
your comment is the definition of rhetorical cherry picking of facts  what do you think it takes to staff a 247 survivor hotline and crisis center on both sides of broadway  you make it sound like there has been no start to create progress on this issue of sexual assault on columbias campus but there have been steps taken
i get why they re protesting during days on campus
how are they powering the projector if this is nt a sanctioned event
a longass extension cord
a long assextension cord

i get why they are protesting during days on campus
not judging but honestly curious
they know the administration will pay attention to them since days on campus is important for getting admitted students to actually choose columbia  this weekend
honestly
the force is strong in this one
judge
buy
good troll
this is amazing  days on campus is a lie
tracked to the same person as pragmatist
for some reason
columbia protects rapists in the same way that it protects due process
bazinga
rape happens everywhere
why did they keep trying to hang up signs when public safety was telling them to do it another time  if public safety is letting you know you have zero right to be protesting there
it is shameful on how disrespectful nrt is to others around them  yes
yes
bro
i so disagree with this  is this really a productive way to protest  it s very unclear what nrt is even trying to accomplish  is it just to piss administrators off  very unclear to me
first the info session interruption
can we stop making prospective student events the battleground on which this war for accountability is waged   this is a fantastic articulation of my problem with this  honestly
this post is phenomenal  i believe that columbia is failing in many ways
there is a more effective way of delivering this message to current and prospective students that does not sensationalize or terrorize individuals  this tactic is just crude and unprofessional
ok
obviously i believe this message should get out to all prospies
most of the comments branding nrt as  shameful
i m a columbia student and i agree with these comments  this was not the place and time for this kind of protest  as a survivor walking past this tonight i felt very triggered  i do nt need that when i m trying to do final projects
barnard student here
another barnard student
is it actually possible for you to know that
yeah
um
i m a parent and keep my eye on what s going on at columbia  daily247
alum
i may not agree with their methods
nrt  selfrighteous
i do believe the rape actually happened
captain america  civil war on fun
prezbo cancelling his fun run because of prison divest  another case of a group that has a good mission and maybe overkills with the tactics
damn
at least the prospies can see how much you fuckers hate your nrt groupviolets 19
yes
private property bitch
nrt people must live in some twisted parallel universe
i know that their intentions are good
i do nt mean to be nitpicking
i think  triggering  refers to reminding me of a trauma and  traumatizing  refers to an event that in and of itself is traumatizing  but i think groups like nrt have definitely stripped it of its meaning through overuse
the important point is that you recover
as i said in my previous post
totally agree with you  as a fellow survivor
no red tape sounds more like no due process to me
these girls need mrs degrees
they need the d
i ca nt imagine that this protest will not deter at least some prospectives from choosing columbia  hearing that  columbia has a rape problem  must scare at least some people
student body not study body
no matter your  probably boring andor wrong  opinion on nrtthis protest
a better headline  students project their own uselessness onto columbia
i am seriously just looking for clarificationwhat exactly does nrt expect from columbia s administration  to they have a mission statement or platform that outlines actual changes that colbia can implant in reality  all i saw thus far was slogans
seriously
i guess they do not answer because they are not really interested in dialogue  the image that i got from them is that they want to protest
idiots  just idiots  they just stooped down to javale mcgee s level  having  a thought process problem
i am just going to say this on every article about idiots at this school  stupidity has taken over
the  unidentified woman  is a grad student and ghd who responded to complaints from studentssurvivors who felt very uncomfortable with the message that nrt was sending  she was standing up for her students  so please sejal take down your obnoxious facebook post when this woman was protecting survivors more than you
just wondering where you heard this from  writing an article and would like to know the source of this info
you should reach out to her and talk to her yourself
i just do nt get how nrt ca nt see that their actually just making columbia an even more hostile environment
columbia needs to arrest these studentsanad throw them in jail  they are breaking the law  they are a disgrace to the community
they better not ruin graduation for everybody who has worked so hardi hope they increase security  how incredibly selfish  terrorizing and harrassing the university and students is not productive and is a crime
i really liked the red tape on hats at graduation last year  a subtle
it s itonic that this article has a  trigger  warning in order to maintain sensitivity towards students who have had to experience sexual violence
the school has a problem  like every other school in the nation  right now you have a bunch of very confused high school kids wondering what s going on in the columbia community  they re wondering why someone would take a very difficult and sensitive subject
why would the prospies want to join a school that these people also attend  i ca nt help but ask myself the same question
but the protesters do nt attend this school  they re barnard students
they should change their group name to pg  pussy guards
lunch happens here too why is no one talking about that
i am enjoying all aspects of this morality play thoroughly
the nrt protesters at that event were mainly barnard students  for example
not really though  zoe
the ones that do protest with nrt should really let ccseas fight their own battles though  barnard students have nothing to do with days on campus and columbia s prospective students
people on butler 6 just tried to hang a protest banner from the window  i removed the banner and i urge that people protest the right way
politics is not about people s personal feelings  i am so disgusted by how low the bar is at a place where supposedly  smart  people go  stop using personal discomfort or whatnot as an argument against nrt s political move  not a coulumbia student and fucking grateful to not be one
not caption necessary  bwog fail
does emma still carry that mattress around
sometimes
hmm  but no one has been expelled  got it
have worked with her closely in the past
oh for sure
can speak from personal experience
amazing

the group no red tape is demanding that columbia improve their adjudication process
your efforts are of a teenager throwing a tantrum because their parents wo nt give them what they want  more and more extreme actions are no longer drawing support from the student body but actually makes you look like a bunch of unhinged college students destroying a positive message you once had
that gif is weird

maybe someone should stand at the columbia gates issuing trigger warnings to everyone going in   trigger warning  there might be a no red tape protest

pls dun raep guiz srsly
nrt  we get it
nrt clearly also does nt totally understand the  imperfect victim  narrative  as a cis hetero white male but also a survivor  yes
as another columbia cis hetero white male survivor assaulted by a woman
nrt has broadened my understanding of this issue with informative and substantiated claims  they are not using scare tactics in order to hijack attention from fun campus activities  rather
this is soooo fucking boring  nrt
nrt needs to sit down and shut up
this is so embarrassing  that students would actually disrupt family orientation sessions  perhaps the first opportunity for many parents of prospectives to interact with the administrators of the school  in order to bring attention to a manufactured controversy
perhaps nrt does nt always convey their message in the most productive way
and
columbia
nrt  you make me want to do this to you
did the nrt loons just call for  reeducation   ok
lol cuz this did nt even actually happen  cbs news showed up and no red tape were nt there
i m tired of people congratulating nrt for this  bold move  when
it s ironic that nrt has campaigned for there to be trigger warnings in lithum
a meal plan is required
do nt you need a special  quad meal plan  that is more than the standard  300
nope
no they re not
plus you can hear literally everything happening if someone has their window open  zero privacy barnard dorms ftw
it s not all hardwood floors in 600 every suite is different  some have terrible carpet and lots have linoleum
i just love to see white people with every possible structural advantage achieve great things  the legacy of colonialism lives on
do you get tired carrying all that anger around
is an example of your idiocy  this is why you will never achieve great things
all of those great things like enslaving brown people
as a black person fighting for racial justice
liking biochemistry
had a class with her she seemed like she worked really hard  definitely deserves it
smart young woman  congratulations
oh come on
seems like a stand up individual
stephanie gergoudis
steph is bae
so
so we are making a statement that says that representatives of the varsity show are still going to perform
trigger warning  i am about to tell you what the 121st varsity show is really about  bigseanwhy did the administration try to shut down bacchanal  why do nt you ever see big sean and varsity show performing together at bacchanal  why was the lead of the last few varsity shows named sean  open your eyes
i m a little creeped out how alma mater s face is split in half in that picture
is columbia concerned with preserving the innocence of prospies or was the show too critical of the administration and their response to events on and off campus this year
the latter
it was actually censored because the opening number has full frontal nudity
i heard they got permission to slaughter a live animal in the second act
i heard there are going to be women in this yeara performance  boy have times changed
this should nt be that big of a shock  why would admissions show prospective students stuff that makes the school look too bad  it may be true
good points here  imagine you re the administration  you want great students to be turned on to the idea of attending your school  do you show them wellknown
why does nt columbia perform a creative
comparing a corporate job to an education that students pay for  are you and idiot
im shocked that so many students here do nt realize that groundlessly complaining about the administration is 1  going to get them nowhere and 2  shooting themselves in the foot  have some pride in your school and make it look good to prospective students  preserve the image of this school and stop devaluing my diploma  columbia reputation in this country is tanking because of your antics
looks at 61  acceptance ratereads  reputation tanking  explodes
varsity show should advertise and do an unofficial performance on low steps or another building for the prospies  it s complete bullshit that they will not allow the original performance to be done  columbia s administration needs to just stop
it ll be on youtube by the start of summer
varsity show as like an institution is still performing it s just not this year  s varsity show  i do nt see why they re making a big deal out of it
yeah
they were actually told they could nt performed a shortened version of their show
no
the administration censors the days on campus performance every year  what makes this team think they re so special that they can float above that
you literally do not know what happened so stop  the team was told they could rewrite the first act to make it less critical
cole
not me
go v121  you all are amazing  we are all proud of what you are doing
funny
warning  capital letters

they could nt get the cc class president this year
the nacoms
as much as i enjoy seeing randos shit on the nacoms  you got the list wrong  you could only list 12 and two of the people you listed are wrong  nice try
daniel stone
so i do nt know who wrote this
forgot about the track function
wait this list is super wrong  at least be good at snooping if you re gon na leak a list in a bwog comment
why would i want to be part of a senior society that ca nt even rig a ccsc election
dirt
to the office of admissions  okay
as i m sure you can realize
this show is centered on outright hatred of columbia  i bow down to ye troll king of the troll kings  you have my fealty
when we did our days on campus show we just did act 1 straight through  not even touching the moral aspects of censorship
the varsity show
this is the best publicity the varsity show ever could have hoped for  i for one ca nt wait to see it
yaaaasss
your  400 off
for realz  they re friendly
are you going to actually post senior wisdoms from a variety of interesting people this year
can you also ask what their favoriteleast favorite class was
i bet most of them will say 2015
can you also include a question on their least favoritefavorite class here
aviva nassimi
oh no
popular with chemistry
this is very funny
if you re actually interested in registering for classes around data science
the restaurant link is dead
does anyone know which floors are the renovated floors
floors 7 and 8
plimpton is the best
but i feel like if you choose to attend a  women s college  you should learn not to be offended when people refer to the students as  women
woo seniors
looks like more people than bacchanal
love you class of 15
the  unfortunately broke someone  joke is in pretty poor taste
we often use  the war on fun  as a sarcastic way to talk about the stupidity of the administration  but it s important that we acknowledge that the administration has shown time and time again that they will actively try to destroy events that are in any way not under their controlthe war on fun is quite real
great article  fuck the columbia admin  they can not do anything right
i would nt go that far
i certainly would
i agree
i never noticed the lack of female artists  good point  also
this is a perfect example of the shit reporting bwog has resorted to  thank you for an article that tells me everything i already know and saw happen  it s clear your own opinion bleeds through and you are against bacchanal
hey there  current students on campus are not the only readers of bwog  students studying abroad and alums  and other randos not affiliated with columbia at all  also read bwog  i thought this article was very informative and effectively condensed a bunch of previously written articles  it gave me a better perspective on what happened this yearalso
this article promotes rape culture
public safety is out of their minds if they think there were 3k students there during big sean  it was closer to 500 on the plaza
that estimate is so off base  i ve thrown concerts with real time ticket scanning and i can tell you that crowd was at least 2k
yo you should probably just come to wbarbq
when i saw this article
abc and the student councils are talking this week about whether or not to run the bacchanal committee under the four councils  that way
can we talk about the fact that entering the concert was like a fucking checkpoint in a police state
this year s bacchanal was a dystopian version of something that used to be fun  my favorite part of bacchanal was always seeing everyone chilling outside
i think this article was incredibly well written and accurately describes how many of us felt about this process  well done
150
no
go nicole
nicoleeeeeeee  3  3  3 role model
nicole is the best  3  3  3 you re an inspiration to all of us
damn i thought it was gon na be me
congratulations
so that s what big sean looks like  go figurewell
you probably could nt see from the back of the lawns
cool now photograph the administration s undying contempt for the student body
so real it hurts
what about this is exclusive  did you get back stage but they did nt let spec  what is the deal
sometimes we use the word  exclusive  to feel better about ourselves  anna received a cool press pass from bacchanal
anna hotter gurrrrl fuckin slé
fuck all the people with their phones out in the first picture
the mouse problem is not a fcking joke  i came back from spring break to find one rotting behind my stove and that was just one of the many little  friends  i ve had to dispose of this year
rising juniors looking for a double should think of woodbridge as their first choice
no 2015 freshmen housing reviews
watt s review was posted the day juniors are picking into watt

each room has its own kitchen and bathroom
like how are you posting a review of a building 3 days into housing selection  and for an indemand building like watt that has so many rooms taken day 1
drag ha
the people in mixed groups of 5 will be forced to drop down to individual online selection  alternatively
no
is it possible to switch rooms within a ruggles suite after selection today  does ruggles have physical keys or swipe access for the rooms within a suite
yes
is there a room left in symposium or not
awesome
capital in the twentyfirst century was published in april 2014 that s one year ago
what number are they on now
when do mixedpoint groups pick  tonight or tomorrow
mixedpoint groups will pick tomorrow morning
when is senior regroup
why are people picking into symposium when they do nt even know how big the rooms are
a couple of people we ve spoken to after choosing symposium said they thought it has more of an  apartment  feel than other dorms  they also liked the bonus of not having to sign people in
how many 5 person groups were made in senior regroup
1 5person suite left in all of ec
anybody know why there were ten watt singles yesterday but only five today  i thought those only went through online selection
5 watt 1 bedroom apartments have been taken in the past couple days of housing selection  thus
just quitting and not reporting on senior regroup
we apologize for not being at senior regroup this afternoon  but do nt worry  we ll be at all of the rest of the regroups for housing selection  our numbers in the spreadsheet above should be up to date with the selections made in regroup this afternoon  sorry to let you down
i think the  ariana hande  reference was a fun way to say they masturbated
surprised bwog did nt catch the masturbation joke
this story sucks

it s seriously the law that everywhere has to have heating  how does the heating in harmony work
actually though this carnival theme is terrifying
3 of them are ra suites
never felt so good
bwog put the numbers up for the ec ra suites why bother listing them with no count
watching the suites go with more intensity than my junior roommate
spec says there are two 5person hogans left but you say they re all gone     who do i believe
alas
keanu  keep the hbob legend aliveeeeee  h606 forever and always the best suite exist
what are the counts supposed to represent  how many are left or how many have been taken
how many are left  the time to panic is now
spec counts for ec 6person suites  4 single 1 double  are different   bwog says 6 and shaft says 13
any note about the barnard quota
what s the deal with the 7th floor hogan suite that 4 people can pick into  housing has it listed as  hogan  4 in 6 person suite wsra  is  sra  just a typo
ur with the building s ca
why is there such a discrepancy about the ec 6 person suits  housing count and bwog count are very different  any word on this
suites
bye jillian
rude and unnecessary
can someone respond to this  which is most accurate so us fucked can figure out plan z
why are there so many 4person options left  did the groups turn into dust or something
thanks for these
there is no way for data to be be  superstatistically significant   it either is or it is nt
on tuesday
this writer has conflated brian siebert  who did not attend barnard  and siobahn burke  who did   the shift between them occurs in the fifth paragraph

i went to all the pregames then slept with ariana hande
i want a refund
hahahahahahahahahaha omg omg so funny you re hilarious everyone who reads your comment will laugh
that time grad students were dumped on with the  you re not invited  message and felt like second class citizens on the other side of the fence
that s because your student life fees do nt go into paying for the concert
stop being creepy and trying to hang out with undergrads  there are already more of you
not being creepy  at all  also
that s what i love about these undergrads
here is my story  i got drunk at 9 am and fell asleep before bacchanal even started
waiting on line for 90 minutes for a wristband
best bacchanal ever  not  next time i d appreciate an option to opt out of paying for a concert i ca nt attend
i want to know what that fight between the two girls was about
this is a waaaaay better option than ec  high ceilings
do carleton arms
wow the angledistortion of that photo makes it look like mcbain is this tower amongst some quaint college town

jk this is harmony hunter
this is the same review as 2014

every party is allowed to host a meet and greet with food
alright but they offered people brownies if they d explicitly vote for them  they had computers out and we re trying to convince people to vote for them on the spot  it was never  hey you should vote in the ccsc election   instead it was  hey you should vote for us in the ccsc election we have computers for you to vote right here
they make take our gpa
oh lord  i hope esc does nt burn itself to the ground  every member incumbent member delta seas puts over 10 hours a week into council
not a secret that true blue played dirty to win  right from filing violations that were nt needed to promising positions to people for votes
rude
obviously the electorate did not agree

if this is 1776 what about the plane at 407  so much for  integrity  bwog
loved the airplane at 407      what a cameo
cuss i luv u gurl but pls dont let whoever directed this hold a camera ever again
446 so shaky i felt nauseated
yeah  sorry about that  the no budget part means we do nt have a tripod and neither my lens nor camera has in body stabilization  i was hoping to have done stabilization in post but looks like it was nt done  that part at the end was done with our primitive camera stabilizer
imats  3rd floor lehman  has free tripods for rent  any student can rent the equipment there
is the above comment lara or just someone else who loves exclamation points and the    face  you decide
found out
really well performed but there s just nothing to work with here  bad idea
i did nt have a problem with the idea or the writing  i agree with the shit filming and editing though  ie  the music felt out of place
funniest thing about this sketch was the aeroplane and that was nt even intentional  well done
makes my life
1  most columbians were actually in support of the tory cause when the revolution came  hamilton and jay were rogue in this sense  2  women were nt a part of the picture until three centuries later  in 1983

that stationery  since when is new york ever written without initial caps

i could not think of how abby could have done a worse job as vp comms this year
and welcome vp policy abby

the proper abbreviation for public safety is cups not cps  cps is columbia physiological services
counseling and psychological services
bwog
waaaaah waaaah waaah big bad bwog not taking us seriously waaaaah
read that like harold from hey arnold  is saying it
what s very sad is that there are two joke parties  they are going to split the joke party vote and the incumbent student leader bums will take it
maybe that s unfortunate
i think dan is cute
but which one though
he s as cute as he is a dreadful tool
vote flf
who in their right mind would ever vote for these dimwits
also dan stone is a horrible human being
can confirm
bwog
does the fact that crosswalk is in the left of the photo mean that croissant is leftwing in her political opinions
some of this is outright wrong  6th floor doubles are among the first to go in the sophomore round
hey  that 302913 is us  we got a summer transfer into our suite
this year ec6 doubles went to transfers
when i lived on the 6th floor
also the bathrooms are relatively new
do food delivery people know how to get to ec
no
to clarify a few points  i m a sophomore on the 6th floor of ec living there now  i had a number around 1600 and was one of the last to get it  the even side is ridiculously good

field hockeyyou re on the rise  you ve almost achieved your goals
very glad to see steps taken to overcome bacchanal s incompetence  when will the next 2
so will bacchanal ticket holders not be able to go on the lawns  and will lawn ticket holders not be able to go to the steps  instead of stratifying admission
are you not entertained
wait so are the lawns allocated just for students with lawn tickets or are they open to all ticket holders
thanks for all the information abc
the statement also requires increased communication between abc and bacchanal in the future   really that s it  weak
damn this was bad  like really bad
error in second to last paragraph  should be  malone
very interesting article  thanks for the report
not all child molesters are concept of the pedophile  many  i think most
also
how far should sympathy and empathy going  noone says that pedophiles are better persons than average if they do nt offend  there is no medal or prize for not abusing children  but a person who is attracted to children and do nt act on it is not a monster
that person did not say they should be in jail  they did not claim to want to police thought  do nt be obtuse  they made some great points about power imbalance and societal expectations of men
there s nothing that can prove to me they ca nt help it  that puts you at odds with every scientist who has studied pedophilia
i am not sure i understand you well  a lot of child molesters are nt pedophiles
consense is definitely not a word  in fact
i agree with j s comment  the idea that pedophilia is an illness first and foremost is totally unfounded  why are most pedophiles men  unless these researchers are suggesting there is a gene found mainly in men that triggers these thoughts
the idea that pedophilia is an illness first and foremost is totally unfounded  why are most pedophiles men   every mainstream psychological organization in the world agrees that pedophilia is a mental illness  many mental illnesses have gender biases
many mental illnesses have gender biases
by insisting we be more sympathetic to pedophiles
this was supposed to be a response to comment of lyntod from march 25
seriously  when are we going to stop portraying pedophiles as victims  taking them out of prison is nt going to help anyone  if anything
it is not natural or justifiable to have sexual feelings for children   i m not sure why anyone would need to  justify  having a mental illness
schizophrenia is nt natural  what  where do you think it comes from
and again we see people blithely compare homosexuality to pedophilia  why not flip it around this time
heteros not heaters  damn autocorrect
i am a life coach who has dealt with hundreds of men and women with pedophilia through the association for sexual abuse prevention  iasaporg   i do not  cure  pedophilia but can help you minimize and manage any risk that you might sexually interact with a child
professor tromovitch and the psychologist bruce rind  of temple university  in 1998 published an article written together with based on a peerreviewed metaanalysis of 59 studies which used the selfreported experiences of child sexual contact with adults by 35
anon is correct and letourneau is wrong  there is no evidence that sexual activity  in and of itself  harms children  societal reaction to child sexuality seems to do most of the harm  in the rind study

which way is the stage facing
toward but
daily double
thanks but no thanks  i will miss bachannal this year
it s free  do you read
gssc is nt helping pay their part  how is that fair
seriously  cheap ass gsers  they should pull some money from their endowment or take out a loan  their education here is paid for just like everyone else s  what a selfish school
wait
nice try
is the undergraduate student ticket for low plaza
the word to describe residents of afghanistan is afghanafghani is a unit of currency
what s this business about  300 tickets remaining
the post is missing a footnote   about 300 tickets were either held for the flip population
while i think it sounds like a great thing to have not charged for flip
seriously  disband bacchanal board  i thought it d be a cold day in hell when the student councils are more transparent than a student group
the lawns were always open  you re telling me you want to close campus to thousands of undergrads who ll spend the whole day drinking anyway  where do you think they ll go  tons of crazy dorm parties will make it much harder to reach students who need medical attention
i do nt think the lawns are supposed to be open by april 4looks like councils
the lawns were going to be cordoned off so no students could be on them  peter bailinson and marc heinrich pushed really hard over break
what if the other councils do nt agree  how will esc cover it all
if i understand correctly  anyone on ccsc can tell me otherwise
gssc is not paying
source  they are refusing to pay
they wo nt shoulder the burden of bacchanal s fuckups
fuck all you gs grandpas  least you can do to not look like total pricks is pull your depends up
gs grandpas  seriously  the average age of the college is in the mid 20s right now lol
that is
what does this mean for student use of the lawns beforeafter bacchanal  are we going to be shut out for preparation and restoration of the lawns
what direction is the stage going to be facing
south
so does that mean the people who got tickets already are now going to be facing the back of the stage
the stage was changed to face butler if it remained facing low
why so many abstentions
you are a dirty whore

schapiro is sexy  the unisex bathrooms contain luxurious and private thrones  and not many ppl know that there is a swimming pool in the basement
shapiro is amazing

as cathy s daughter
i have no words  cathy was such an incredible and inspiring person  i am so so sorry to hear of her loss  i am 100  convinced i would have dropped out of barnard it was nt for her guidance and her tremendous empathy  she was such a powerhouse and will be dearly missed
professor nepomnyashchy was an endless source of isnpiration as my advisor in the second ever ukrainian regional studies major for columbia university  i graduated in 2011 she will be missed and treasured greatly
olga
professor nepomnyashchy was constantly helping and inspiring russian department students at columbia and barnard
thanks bwog i needed this
1   too much of a man to pee in a stall   i just came from a svr session about this  please do nt use this kind of language2  why are you taking the elevator one floor  3  this bathroom is super busy before and after my scherm classes4  please do lerner
this comment is 100  accurate 1010 a
this is only going to make more problems  same amount of excluded people except this time some of them got tickets the first time
this will probably get exactly 4000 upvotes
are they going to be refunding the  133 fee on every ticket  i d assume that s impossible to get back from eventbrite so they d really want to throw away over  5000 of student s money  keep up the hard work everybody
actually that s being refunded as well
crunch the numbers
why not host bacchanal at baker s field  will probably hold more than 4000 ppl  put it to goodbetter use
has the bacchanal board even considered this  potentially 2x the occupants
because it would nt be columbia without constant disappointment
yes
if they we re going to make such a sweeping statement
oh shut up you ingrate
has literally just never been a problem  last year during lupe s set we were on the  upper  part of the steps and there literally was like empty space around us  i know big sean is  bigger  lol  more expensive or whatever  issue tickets
i do nt think you actually understand what literally means
im confused
no
and just when i thought this whole situation could nt get any more absurd  of all the situations they could have come up with
all the solutions
i m grateful our student representatives are as committed as they clearly are to addressing the obvious problems with the ticket rollout  having put some time into creating this measure  but this is deeply flawedyes
i m pretty sure you re the only one who had to rearrange your schedule to find two minutes to buy a ticket online
thankfully
im pretty sure more than 4000 people are stuffed into that space every year at university commencement
this is a joke right  this is what our councils think resolves an issue  who is making these asinine decisions  yay  let s let hose who bought tickets on time try again  ha
this is not supposed to be a ticketed event anyway so the whole ticket purchase event was pretty stupid in the first place
is every student leader at this school on crack
ccsc voted against this
are nt we smart enough to solve all these problems lol
the resolutions completely miss the point  bacchanal should not have been a ticketed event in the first place
our administration is filled with filthy gypsies  taking away tickets from those who go them is disgusting  we should institute a mass gate crash or pass back system
racist
why is the  4000 person limit something that can not be helped   i m sorry but it s our money  why does some flaccid administrator get to unilaterally set the capacity  this is crap  in 68
it seems absurd to think that there will constantly be the same 4
can someone explain who  10000 covers  28000
can someone explain how  10000 covers  28000
because they did nt need  28
when snoop came they set up on butler and had the students on lawns  why is this not being considered  it seems like more students could fit there
allegedly bacchanal committee is considering this  did they keep the lawns open for snoop lion
the stage is being reversed this year
baker field or bust  it s not like the football team will be using it
like a bunch of dipshit rentacops or fucking  lion tamers  are going to be able to stop anyone from hopping the gates to see a concert held on low steps  if i do nt get a ticket
this is wrong on so many levels  just disgusting  nothing worse than taking back tickets from people who have them  everyone who signed this resolution is a disgusting human being with no absolutely no integrity  i will be creating a website with all of your names outlining this lack of integrity for future employers  good like to status seekers like brian wu
that is mighty tough talk for someone who wants to keep there own name anonymous  if you want to threaten people you should step up and say who you are
who cares
ca nt wait
ccsc voted against this noob
who ca nt afford to pay  7 for a ticket
ever heard of racist comments
i know that chokeholds are not allowed by the nypd
we ve requested internal use of force guidelines and are awaiting response
also please get clarification of the difference between a chokehold and a headlock
we were sent two pieces of information   the  your rights and responsibilities  guide
other arm of the officer is not behind the students neck or applying pressure to the neck so as to cause a lock build pressure  therefore this is not really a choke  it s not possible to execute an air or blood choke with one arm
is it a headlock  is it a chokehold  should public safety be allowed
hia face is not blurred in the thumbnail for the link on the facebook page
oh no the mossad might see him
they re chevrons
zing
the fact this kid is getting treated as the victim is disgusting  maybe you should nt try to pick a fight with an officer  this school has gone so soft  screw this kid
the fact that you do nt believe in due process disgusts me  also the fact that you have no clue what you re talking about disgusts me
you have it dead on  he should have a proper trial before he s put in a headlock
yea
he did nt show up to his sexual respect workshop
you joke about it but i have friends who know the guy he actually got kicked out of carmanhousing for stalking a girl and trying to force his way into her suite
sounds like anonymous nailed it
aaand now there s a comment saying he was talking about trying to rape the girl  sounds like a real nut
i bet most of the athletes here work harder and are more driven than you
come on man
if he was violently stalking this girl
well
legit tho what happens if you do nt go to that bullshit
looks like that black officer is pretty racist  on the count of three everyone downvote
on three
was it an actual choke hold or did the officer use a headlock  they look similar but are completely different  a headlock is used to control a persons body from the neck
this might not be a chokehold  you re right
actually some chokeholds do work by cutting off air from the lungs  chokeholds are nt as specific as you claim  anything that cuts off air supply is a chokeholdthat said
sorry
i have three eyes  and i declare it not a chokehold  checkmate
the kid more than likely started the fight  the officers here are great from my experience and definitely would nt do any of this unwarranted
and two plus two equals four
that s a headlock
headlocks are also potentially lethali do nt think we can support use of potentially lethal force on an unarmed student
but pretty much any way to restrain somebody combative is potentially lethal
were they arresting him for not completing the sexual respect requirement
this is disrespectful to the student and should be taken down
getting into a physical fight is disrespectful and beyond rude and warrants arrest  if you do nt want to be on bwog do nt be an asshole and do nt get in fights
why does the black officer have a choke hold on a white unarmed college student
why is bwog posting this without knowing any of the facts  this is disgraceful
this is nt what police abuse looks like  if you think this is what police abuse looks like you have no idea what people have been protesting over  let s see if instead of a white boy picking a fight in a columbia dorm room with the always friendly and helpful public safety officials this was a black kid picking a fight with an officer on 125th
oh ok  i think i understand  people have been protesting over violence against black people
situations like this are not unusual here at all  i have been having a conversation with a group of friends  all of us are black  on multiple occasions and seen them walk past larger
yall commenters are racist misogynists      hope you re proud of yoursekves
i wonder if he can breathe
the man in the white shirt is not nypd  he s a sergeant or lieutenant in cups
public safety is not allowed to touch students  that is a one of public safety s statutes  mcshane has said this to me himself
incorrect  public safety can use force when required to protect themselves or another person  this includes restraining students who pose a danger to themselves
this has almost nothing to do with the chokeholdheadlock  the first question is  why is he in an altercation with the police
anyone else ever wonder what their own skin taste like  like i sometimes just want to take a bite our of my arm just to try it  idk is that weird
has anyone considered that maybe this kid was having some mental health issues and that they were merely responding by restraining him from hurting anyone
i was present during the event and was less than 10 feet away from the kid in that very image in the picture  given the events in ferguson
this is bullshit  if you re just a  bystander  no need to post anonymously   p
the choke hold was not ferguson
give public safety credit for preventing a rape  i was in hartley and this guy was telling the officer at the desk that he was going to force a girl
this is blatantly false  do nt make up facts to create sympathy for the offending officer  i am an ra and i have details to the actual story
sorry dude
can confirm that it s true he got kicked out of housing for going after the same girl  not a stretch to assume he was back for more
he was asking for it
rest in peace
how do u get permission to watch this
someone dun fucked up posting this
amazing
did nt see that one coming
this is wallach not barnard  so much for  integrity  bwog

hi bwog
as demonstrated in a current lawsuit against the university of oregon
not much else to say
i beat off to this guy
but i still want to kill you
when are those wimpy fucks going to issue their next statement
futile banality of your studies  pls change this line
fuckin  love this guy  agree with other commenter that  futile banality of your studies  is a stupid line but it s kind of in the spirit of the whole thing
dodge only has six floors  so
what about the limited tickets and their cost
what about the sweatshirts they soldfunds they accepted from abc without telling anyone they were charging for tickets
there will be a separate post for those two questions
this is totally what we were all upset about
people are targeting members of the bacchanal board  the administration made these people jump endless hoops and they still managed to get us a concert with a relevant artist  sure the date
still managed to get   the 4000 who clicked first today   a concert
but still not their fault
misrepresenting their funding plans in order to get the same large allocation as always definitely was their fault  i am now paying for their concertthe least they could do is release a  thank you for your money  statement to all the students who are nt able to get tickets
the 4
that chief was almost surely drunk  none of this makes any damn sense  for starters low steps are made out of stone  they are very unlikely to start on fire  second
they use it for whtv  the chaplain kicks people out of st paul s using that excuse even though the whole building is made of stone and bricks and there s no cloth to be found other than the altar  plus there s insurance for the whole building from both schools
that s why the choir has nt been allowed to sing there since like 1995
tbh id rather not have a bacchanal then have all of this stress about buying tickets and my friends getting left out
these isis fools hate the jews and christians  its time for a new crusade
i m not even that angry because what do you expect from columbia  but as a christian
at least i ll be drinking 4 cups of wine at my seder
i m just kind of pissed that no one thought to email barnard students about this  like if you re not 100percent on top of your shit or are maybe a little distracted because midterms or your job or your job midterms or whatever reason you re going to be completely blindsided by the ticket sales  next year are we going to have to be signed in to lowe steps
i hope so
educate yourself on your university and its undergraduate schools  fourth down on this list for reference
girl do nt waste your time trying to justify your existence to first years
barnard is an affiliate undergraduate institution
lol more like barnyard amirite  killing it          stupid bitches making us say  first year  i have literally never been more censored in my entire life
educate yourself on your university and its undergraduate schools  fourth down on this list
says it all
i assumed rob lowe built it with his west wing money
from spec  after april 11the saturday during days on campuswas ruled out
sucks anyway  how about a concert with a band
about the baccontroversy  i know that this is a stressful time and that bacchanal s a big deal to all of us  but seriously
of course you do nt have a ticket
seriously
this  actually write to the deans
what a concert with a pop artist one of these days    jessie j for example is performing at yale
was the fall bacchanal artist really going to be arcade fire
honestly
you have to pass but  t  ler
say what you will
i checked bwog b4 using the bathroom today  thx
they are renovating the bathrooms in mudd
what a clusterfuck
does this mean we ca nt be on campus  what do these tickets even give you access to  the steps
unofficial  fuck cu  party in front of butler  listen to music for free

this sounds like more fun than actual bacchanal tbh
mandatory earplugs will be distributed for all who did not receive tickets
this is pretty fucking ridiculous  thanks columbia
haha another reason why columbia sucks holy shit
i left for my internship at 7 am and did not get home until now and tickets are gone  no access until a computer  this is really sad as a senior
smartphone  sorry dudette
yo heshe was at work and is obviously professional enough to not whip out their phone to buy tix to a big sean concert
a full workday without a bathroom break  give me a break
but who is realy to blame for all of this  it is of course the columba spectator truly a blight on our great universidad
finally sold out my first concert     d  d  d  d
they ll definitely release more because they only made 28k today which is nt nearly enough to cover the 50k wasted on fall bacchanal

so not enough tickets
cristen scully krommdean of undergraduate student lifeckromm  columbiaeduphone  2128546806this is her and the rest of student life s fault  please tell them how ridiculous this is
with sales beginning at 8 am
gg
im excited to sit back and eat my popcorn as i watch columbia try to alleviate the situation for the 6000 undergrads  including myself  plus grads who can not attend  good luck with this one
the other weird thing is that eventbrite does not offerrequire any kind of verification of uni or enrollment status or anything  anyone with a link could have bought tix   not without running into problems day of
that s not true  when you start the actual purchasing process it asks for your name and later your uni and your columbia email
yea but you could easily enter bullshit  there was no authentication of those details  the ticketing platform should have been through a university website
watch out for the tickets about to be sold for  50 each by the scalper who bought them all with fake unis
so now that the administration has solid evidence on the stupidity of this ticket cap of 4
i did nt get paid until tomorrow  i was going to wait until tomorrow until i had the money to buy the ticket  now you re telling me i ca nt go because i waited a fucking day
i do nt give a fuck
except donate once you graduate pls
rarely do you see a double comment by the same person so highly rated  well done

it s almost like columbia is trying to find ways for me to not want to donate when i m an alum   krommspiracy
is it just that the presale tickets are sold out
it was capped to 4
this never stopped them before
wait but commencementclass daypast bachannals
guess i ll be  going to butler  for the first time all yearhehe
not everyone here has  838 to spend at a moment s notice  i currently have  247 on my debit card and  3 cash  that s all the money i have in the world literally  and do nt get paid until friday  some of us have to pay our own tuition and costs because our single parent works 2 jobs just to pay the mortgage  feed a sibling and can not send us money  period  this is downright ridiculous
fyi
we did nt know we had to plan for this  ticket sales started 12 hours after this was announced
people ca nt plan for an unexpected expense  i think this is exactly what the above was talking about re poor financial planning
actually this was announced at least a week and a half ago  at least to gs  that s why we knew to do this
can everybody just boycott the concert so that when big sean shows up nobody is there
wow
were nt they all reserved for columbia students
reserved for columbia as in reserved for columbia and not barnard
bacchanal tickets up on stubhub for  20
fuck off bwog way to delete all of our comments
between the columbiamandated middleschool style sexual respect workshops and this
ugh i wish i could get a refund  i got a ticket but my boyfriend many of my friends did nt
i have 2 tickets for sale
instead of people just complaining here
since everyone s student life fees were used to put on this event
how many people attended bacchanal last year
not blaming bacchanal committee because they probs were forced to follow these regulations by the administration but why could nt the process be more transparent  i mean it is our fees that actually bring this event to light  maybe if the process of choosing the venue and how the administrators wanted a cap was disclosed to the general student body
ben kornick s linkedin profile boasts that he  oversee  s  marketing initiatives  for bacchanal   quadrupled attendance from 1
email did not say that there were only 4000 tickets  it s one of those things you should probably mention  which makes me thing they left that detail out on purpose  maybe because they did nt think it would sell out that quickly
why are we celebrating columbia again  transferring
i heard about a way to get onto the roof of lowe recently  we should throw a party up there and get schwasted
nah bitch u got ta grow up quick
i m sure you feel all high and mighty with your anonymous smear campaigns and unwarrented namecalling  ben
you think 6000 out of the 10
exactly that s a large majority  i was nt even given a chance to think about whether i wanted to purchase one
the bacchanal committee failed to inform abc that it d be charging for tickets and essentially cheated their way into a higher allocation from the student life fees of students who ca nt even fucking attend nowso do nt fucking try to defend their actions bc they were complicit in this
racism and general bigotry are ignorance  i m personally prochoice
that post gave me cancer
so how do you discover the stall status
this is nice
when was the last time you were physically intimate with the person who signed you in
how about cameras so we can see the faces of the  activists  who post false accuse male students on campus of rape  i would make that mandatory   not in the stalls of course
this is a solid piece of content  much like what i left in fayerweather

what s wrong with going to class high  maybe the writer took a few hits too many this time
wow bwog you re so sick you drink and smoke    only you squids could make smoking so fucking lame
people still read bwog three years after graduating
can someone explain why my tuition  is subsidizing an leisure event that i m not allowed to go to
we can go down the list of performing arts groups that are subsidized by student life fees
do nt act like some random dance group s spring showcase is the same as bacchanal
the funding those groups receive is adjusted to account for their ticket revenue
all students
but if you look at most of the paid performances
protest bacchanal  admins are stupid and taking away are bacchanal
i would have sold 20000 tickets at  100  fuckin trust fund babies
bwog
we apologize  we were using the names listed on bacchanal s facebook page and those from the press release  your name has been fixed
the last name was an oversight on our part  apologies

ugh ca nt stand him
well
that was 100  mary boyce s idea
no the  lion tamers  name came from the bach committee itself  when confronted on it being offensive

you re being pathetic  for real
you are missing the point
i know you re just trying to be a classiest smartass
columbia student life on the decline
this is huge  not only is the  7 a really shitty thing to drop on people out of nowhere  especially after they already asked people to pay for sweatshirts
and personally
anyone else see the actual ticket price as  834 instead of just  7  because this was done through eventbrite
wouldnt it have been smarter to maybe sell 4000 tickets to each of the three different performers and then everyone could only buy one
look guys i love hiphop but could we do something a little more interesting  i m sure this will be fun but you know  kendrick maybe     or chance  or gambino

gambino is terrible
ugh they hired the most conscious backpacky rapper last year and yall complained
because we re sick of rappers
but no one will be as good as macklemore was
macklemore was terrible
where the fuck do we buy tickets     the eventbrite is not working
ticket sales began at 800am  take it easy
gambino would be so perfect    ughhh
i dunno about gambino
gambino is black
unfortunately
let s get right on it
let s get right on that
here we go
what the fuck we have to buy tickets this year  is this a fucking joke  if i wanted to buy a fucking ticket to a concert i would just go downtown and go to a concert what the fucking fuck
alright cool
boycottbacchanal
bruh it s  7  lol do a business study
stop assuming that  7 is  not a big deal   for some people it is  they should have warned us about this way more than a month in advance  a lot of people thought they were going to a free concert
sorry  there is not one person at columbia who ca nt spare seven dollars for a single fun day out  college is very expensive
yeah
it s not even about  boycottbachannal
bacchornah
this is fucked up
hopefully he brings ariana with him
while supplies last
wtf is this shit
ok so we have to buy tickets then line up day of to get wristbands  sounds like a clusterfuck waiting to happen
this is going to be a nightmare  also
pretty sure there are much more than 4
yes
there are approximately 10
i m pretty sure that i ve never heard of any other college requiring students to pay for tickets for the spring concert  and most other schools get much better acts than columbia  we pay an insanely ridiculous amount of money to go to this school  that includes a hefty student life fee
that s not true
actually a majority of schools with decent artists for their spring concerts require their students to pay  last year people were bitching about the quality of our headliner and the reason was because columbia was nt charging students at all  a huge amount of people said they were willing to pay a few dollars to get better acts in the future
i think the bigger issue with this is that some people said they would pay a few extra dollars to pull in a bigger headliner
i m a student at williams college  we re not an ivy
1  use your trust fund money to buy a couple thousand bacchanal tickets as soon as you can2  watch as hundreds of horrified students are unable to get their tickets3  wait until april4  scalp tickets to students for 20 bucks apiece5     6  profit
all sales are final  no refunds  tickets are nontransferrable

this is an event put on by the students and has nothing to do with your tuition dollars  columbia never guaranteed you free concert tickets  grow up   however may discount tickets are available in lerner
we do nt pay student life fees just so they can make us pay for literally the only student life even anyone cares about  also
ben kornick should be fired for being inept
fire the person who helped get big sean and made sure the event was nt cancelled all together  yeah
are you for real  bacchanal probably would nt even be happening at all if it were nt for ben and the rest of the board  maybe you should blame the administration for canceling fall bacchanal
let s get some things straightdecided by bacchanal committee  artist lineupcharging tickets  bigger name means more expensive artist  remember we got macklewhore before he blew updecided by administration  lion tamerswristbandsundergrads onlyprobably decided by both  event date
actually they have to charge for tickets this year because the administration is requiring increased security
so yeah fuck him for making us pay so he could book a bigger artist and add it to his resume  no big secret that this guy does it to build his own brand
smh  ben saved bacchanal and had the foresight to book big sean all the way back in the fall  this shit would nt have happened without him  hoe shut the fuck up
how can there only be 4
penn gets big sean for fucking free and we pay                     da fuck is this shit
it is to pay for the added security and other workers  most universities pay
upenn s tickets cost minimum  25 relax
they get 2 days of events
we have plenty of those free events with lesserknown artists  cmf brought hoodie allen
bachascuse me  this is bacchabullshit
just get sws to pay for it
and mare sydney
if you do nt manage to get a ticket
i dont really care about other schools  we go to columbia and baccahanal is supposed to be free  doesnt my 60

who the hell is big sean
see first reply to first comment
did this already sell out    why ca nt i buy a ticket
it says they go on sale tomorrow at 8am
anyone else think that we were getting an actual lion show when they read lion tamers
that would be way more interesting than big sean
helix for bacchanal
helix4obanchlall
i m willing to let the paying for our own tickets thing slide  i feel like because we managed to snag big sean to headline for us
if you go on the eventbrite for bacchanal  i found it through the fb page  it says that guest tickets will only become available after spring break if they still exist
a lot of what you are saying is not accurate  that is the typical number of people that attend the concert every year
thank you so much for your clarifying math  it is not ridiculous at all to have 9000 people and 4000 tickets
you have terrible grammar
not the first time students have had to pay just the first time recently
inserts comment about how disappointed disgusted i am in the administratorsbwogemma sulkowitz for having to pay the equivalent of a drink at 1020 for a concert in my backyardplease note that this feeling will be discarded the moment bacchanal arrives
bacchanal board going ham in these comments
could they comment on the choice of the event date plz  would love to know why practicingculturallyengaged jewish and christian people are not invited kk thx
wbarbq is still gon na be free and open to the public   plus there s free food    and someone told me it s gon na be awesome this year
they should impeach everyone on the bacchanal executive board for messing this up
getting piss drunk in my ec suite  paying for bacchanal and dealing with administration s bullshit
it amazes me how genuinely very angry some people get over this lol
so to the people complaining about the 4
i m wondering where the concert is going to be held exactly  they ca nt shut down all of campus just to the 4
i imagine it s still on the steps and you ll be able to hear from the lawns and such
can someone please explain to me how this ended up being scheduled on passover  and on easter weekend  like who looked at their calendar and thought
i wonder how much control the committee had over picking the date  usually this concert coincides with days on campus  perhaps they wanted to avoid that again and make the concert a little earlier as a result  i m not sure  but i agree
and god is dead  get over it
or you could stop believing in your made up gods you n00b  checkmatechristians
i think it was because big sean was only available for that date  he is going on tour and is around the nyc area around that time  it was more of a when is big sean available  than when are the students at columbia available
i feel like the bacchanal eboard is like the abusive stepfather who hits their stepkids and expects thanks for not wearing his rings
alright
oh cool
lineup is too mainstream
okay yeah so rap is cool
i m not a huge rap fan but tbh you just ca nt dance to the lumineers the same way   ツ
i d appreciate a female performer soon
ddddddj jared weiss
are they charging to make sure no one from harlem shows up to the concert
um  nothey are charging to buy a bigger act  sorry if that does nt fit into your  everything is racism  narrative of the world
fyi
can he bring ariana too   i will pay double for ariana
anyone else trying to buy tickets and the website says no tickets available  were nt the supposed to be available starting at 8 am
806 am no tickets available
where da tix at
still no tix
lupe is the best to ever spit
we should execute the bacchannal board in the guillotine
nah its cool i m busy that day anyway  no worries
this suckz
lol looks like im not going to bacchanal this year  next year can we please mix it up with the music  something decent preferably
and  all the tickets are gone
i just saw a comment on facebook where someone was bemoaning the fact that international women s day is just one day  joking that she did nt know she was nt supposed to be celebrating her gender for the other 364 days in the year  this was the stupidest thing i have ever read
chill
prezbos closet is much bigger than your single
this reminds me of dante s inferno
bathroom in wien smells so bad  but what can we do   bwog
i thought it was just floor 7  so good to know there are others out there fighting the good fight alongside me
try living as a homeless gs student  lol
the dumbest article wtf
way inappropriate to allude to the rest of this post on the home page as the part  after the jump  considering what happened last semester
all of you downvoting this post are missing the hilarious joke
who was at the door
wien psychosis is real    check out the wien zine  continue its legacy
wow
i ve only met him like once but andrew ren seems like one of the most likeable people on ccsc
i ca nt tell if this is satire or not  i m looking into living in either ruggles or east campus this summer and i definitely do nt want rats
not satire  i live in ruggles and it is literally disgusting  the 8 person suites are especially bad  i would give anything for a nice woodbridge double  save yourself and live elsewhere
what about east campus   columbia only gives 2 options for the summer for visiting students  the websites make both dorms look amazing

tat trying to get into ruggles
ruggles is nice and amazing location  minutes from everything
woodbridge da goat
you really should include the actorsdirectors names in your review and give them the credit they deserve  we know you ve never written a review before but that seems to be common sense
jawn
oh my god i need this for my suite  it s like a bsl4 level hazardous site
i agreed with everything
is this actually a thing that people  eye roll  at  i feel like half of my friends babysit or do similar jobs and it seems to be considered a pretty normal thing to do
why do we need to defend rich white girls watching the kids of other rich white girls and making way too much money for doing so  i feel like it s never been under attack
da fuck
babysitting for your professor is kind of weird
is she serious  everyone babysits get over yourself
everyone except dudes
if your peers eyeroll at you babysitting you just have a stupid group of peers  more than half of the girls i know here babysit
from the article  guys are just fundamentally less trustworthy than girls
that last line sounds like trollingi can see how guys would be less likely to get a babysitting job since some parents irrationally believe that  any man who wants to hang around children is probably a pedophile
who on earth judges people for babysitting  it s a completely normal thing to doway to make money  whatalso
bwog
i never felt that babysitting was something that i needed to defend until reading this article  i hope that it was just written in a way which did not give off the original intention behind the piece
fun and pays well
if you feel that way about your hookup
contrary to what you may believe
you do realize heshe was being sarcastic  right
what were you printing
oh
is nt campus about a professor
bwog has lost it utterly
was entertaining
for your future thoughtcatalog posts
15hr  is that reasonable  is asking for more than a 200  raise reasonable  also
it s called basic bargaining
if this happens at columbia
what does this mean for work study  the federal max is something like  12 an hour
lol the atrium is so weird  does anyone remember when it was the hive  good times
this is uniformed and inaccurate  and the weird  hummingbuzzing  sounds validates your lack of understanding of what each floor contributes to research and learning for students majoring in biological sciences
the 12th floor looks like the bio departments less successful sibling  lots of family tension  the 13th floor is clearly the most successful family member     what does this comment make the 11th floor  the forgotten
w00t
with such a diverse and varied student population
i m a freshman as well and i feel the exact same way  i joined a sorority
columbia and college in general can be a disorienting experience for people  i m a junior
some advice from a crotchety old junior  first of all
i do nt wan na discount the writer s experiences or anyone else s from a bougie boston suburb  but i get it there were some  wealther than  her  own
anonymous
you gon na box this comment too
how is that ramen place
well
if you were evacuated and need housing for the night
praying everyone and all fdny people are ok
who the fuck would downvote this
someone who s not big into prayer  satan  hitler
sorry but whether or not you agree with praying  should nt be your first concern when your fellow studentshuman beings are in danger  there s a time and a place for that
lol  neither should praying
doody
this was really scary
completely destroyed  though  let s not get carried away
lol love the people mindlessly downvoting who do nt realize that a comment like  completely destroyed  could really worry a lot of people who might be looking for information on a fire that affected their friend s or relative s dwelling  just saying that in the interest of not freaking people out
temporary housing for students who need a place to sleep
how can we fill out the doc
seconded
ditto
it s on class fb pages  at least it s on the 2017 page
if you re using chrome
wait so you re only allowed to add your suite if you re anonymous   how does this work
here is a form that people can use that has a link to the data  that way there is no 50 person limit
this is the time when columbia boys be nice and hand their beds over to the bc angels
strong independent womyn who want gender equality would find that insulting  the act of a man giving up anything for another woman carries the underlying assumption that the woman is weaker  women can crash on the floor too
grownups are talking  seriously
do nt feed the trolls
we kept ignoring them
here is a form for hosts
do nt see admins offering to host students  what about that scumbag kristen cromm  having students sleep in the gym  unconscionable  for 50k  yr
dean cromm is on the columbia faculty
rofl at cromm being on the faculty  she s an administrator  a masters in social work does nt qualify you to teach
does nt qualify for you to house random students either
too many admin apologists on here  you
you might as well ask prezbo to house students too
dean kromm is great
guys are we really going to do this now  we do nt even know if everyone is safe
fill this for out if you would like to help host  this spreadsheet if you need somewhere to stay
okay
good luck finding and financing a sublet for the rest of the semester
here is a form that people can use that has a link to the data  that way there is no 50 person limit
really hope everyone s safe  except for admins  if one of those low lifes got hit by some shrapnel
ollie s   panera  pret a manger  dreamers can dream
panera  i do nt eat asian food much but still  panera over ollie s
why is nt spar there  why isnt barbard finding new housing for their own students
how is barnard going to survive without a dorm for the next 612 months
how is barnard going to survive without a dorm for the next 612 months of construction
any word on what caused this or if it s safe to go back
did nt ollie s have a fire a few years ago
barnard has handled this all so poorly  asking students to look for housing at 1 am is absolutely ridiculous and expecting us to go into our rooms with toxic fumes
are you fucking kidding me  we do nt even know if everyone is safe yet  so how about we at least hold off on the jokes until the smoke has cleared
imagine how the people working in the admissions office feel when they read these comments   fuck  another mistake
this was  the comment about emma
bwog
go ahead  feel freeit s not as if there s anyone who ll miss singleissue trolls who do nt even go here
barnard lol
nyad is a steroid abuser
i ve never heard of this graduation speaker  is this what it s like to go to cc
my humble opinion
not quite  it is unlikely that a cc student would never have heard of samantha power  sorry
strong pr move on barnard s part announcing right after the fire
i guess this is as close to claire underwood as it gets
bring back radio city music hall
ugh lame speaker for 125th anniversary  i wanted someone not political
creative writing undergrads talking about their process sounds more decadent and indulgent than triple layer chocolate cake  i pick the cake
the blue and white started a blog
hmm what if
got switzerland  actually going to sweden  not bad
boschwo must go  really
guantanamo bay  srsly
i ca nt even with this video
this video is bae
its basic but also basic
yeah
it s baesic


dagan i love u
this video was sorta funny  looking forward to your future stuff
what the fuck is wrong with you
is it free
yes
haha hilarious
jae baby
haha why has no one thought of this before   genius
someone has come up with this idea in every single class i ve taken for my entrepreneurship minor
what about  most likely to get caught having sex in the butler stacks
lol guess i m making my first senior night appearance
will macaulay is so sexy
android
yes
student services rep chris godshall argued that since commuter students dont pay housing fees
because it s primarily a residence hall
bacchanal committee shoulda just booked them as the headliner tbh
ca nt get enough of their sound  congrats
ughhh
is libby single  she s my everything
are you available for snuggling with fans
alluded
getting such psapp vibes from this  also st vincent  also i love this literally so excited for bacchanal
way too much barnard lol
taylor g is bc
professor hirschberg is basically the best
no butler lounge booths
steiner is queen
you got me through flu season  also
that person at the top of the stairs is about to die
why is calling someone a male body part insulting  it should nt be  that is so sexist
is some straight up escher shit
it s really not that hard people
they really should install a redlightgreenlight system to avoid these horrible catastrophes
maybe the fact that these people came to columbia to learn as opposed to fulfilling a  sexual respect  requirement explains why you saw so much eye rolling  because right now i m not uplifted
if you re actually a student why do nt you have a crown by your name  are you commenting from off campus
i m a parent of two students at columbiabarnard and i read both bwog and spectator every day  do you have anything against me commenting here  is it your role to police people s comments
i m certainly not against parentsalumsnonstudents who actually have a stake in columbia commenting  but the spec comments section has become completely unreadable due to nonstudents from reddit or wherever taking over the comments section just to troll
then how come you said  i m not uplifted
lol helicopter parent
columbia seems to selfdestruct just as it s on the verge of greatness  in the 1960s
drags mattress through this thread
lol alienating the jews  come on now over 30  of this campus is made up of jews
feynman wanted to come to columbia but the jewish quota prevented him from being admitted  the liberal atmosphere today is often antizionist or antilikud but i really doubt and do nt hope that jewish students feel unsafe  i m a palestine supporter but i do nt really give a shit about sjp at this point
in the 1960s
awkward
all columbia males should pick the arts option and do stick figure drawings with crayons  every  single  one  of  you   what is the arts option  the arts option offers you a chance to create art and share your work on a curated website and
does this mean that women have to accept the advances of dorks and other betas or is this kind of  sexual disrespect  still allowed  because honestly
also why does nt barnard have to do this too
sorry for your plight dude
sexual respect  means texting a girl the morning after about what a great time you had   what if they did nt have a great time  what if a girl is a jerk and a looney  that s impossible  what ca nt a man or a woman have a one night stand and never contact the person they slept with  it s ok people  do nt get crazy with all this rhetoric
no
if you feel so strongly about this
i hope you were nt being serious about this
i appreciate it but you do nt need to humor me  i ve put myself out there
sorry for the late response  i understand where youre coming from and i believe you  the dating world is unfair and that sucksyou are not the only one who has to spend some time fighting through rejection and selfdoubt  i was there for years
looool this dude is literally talking to himself  check out the track button
beta s been through the wringer already  no need to pick on themalso
ok
what happens if i just  do nt go  will they really withold my degree for this
okay
perhaps they re rolling their eyes at the massive disconnect between what this is and what it s supposed to do  mindfulness is good on its own
how does this have any fing thing to do with sexual assaultgender misconduct
may get something
sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing  the latter is much more nebulous
sexual assault and sexual harassment are not the same thing
there are certain levels of professionalism that professors and staff members should uphold  if a prof is making a student
this is garbage  saying someone has a pretty blouse or i love the design in your jewelry is not sexual harassment in any way
it seems that writing about sexual assault has become right of passage for all the spectatorbwog writers  they all have to give us their opinion on this and frankly
rite of passage not right of passage
thanks
also
also it s dean kromm not dean cromm  sorry to be that guy again
good catch  we appreciate your equitable policing
does nt anyone at bwog and spec proof read
of course
this is decent creative writing
why are you getting fish at a diner
i find it very disturbing that the writerordered fish at a diner  but
we love you charles sanky
these bands are amazing
such an amazing show  well done to the entire columbia university wind ensemble
wtf with this mandatory  sexual respect  nonsense  columbia seems to selfdestruct just as it s on the verge of greatness  in the 1960s
i m so confused  is it george or nikhil
irl vs fb
nice article naomi
true  it did nt seem smart to share an interview with a competing media outlet whose article was coming out two months before mine  but you re right that i neglected to mention it here  thanks for the valid criticism
this was good
this tells me that whatever your school or year within columbia

great job taylor  nice pic too
where is that photo from
sakura park on the claremont avenue side
a bfd
a tech executive and venture capitalist who has had a hand in such great successes as aol and netscape
these companies were basically the internet
horowitz has massive influence in tech
pretty decentbut is ccsc still claiming that there is no formal rule that the class day speaker has to be an alum
i love that mayor garcetti will be speaking  super awesome
great picks
ben horowitz is vcool  a16z is changing venture capital culture
pretty lack luster speakers yet again  even more laughable is the fact that seas could nt even get an engineer  guess the class reps are just trying to suck up to another vc guy  be more transparent
lol what those are the greatest speakers in years
these are not necessarily contradictory statements  has barnard announced yet  i think that if the messiah appeared and turned out to be female
there is a chance that a messiah could wind up as barnard s commencement speaker even if not a female of course
conspiracy theory  barrack obama is female
i m so excited for eric garcetti  he s inspirational
horowitz is paying it forward  his daughter is at the schoolmay be graduating this year  trying to repay columbia for giving her a boost in admissions
pretty sure giving enough
stop taking my comments down   freespeech  freepaul
garcetti was also a rhodes scholar here
is ben horowitz just going to quote rap lyrics for a half hour
i think you really mean liu kangfinish him
thank you for sharing this important message  hope you are staying warm  not listening to  house  music so proud of you xoxo love
wow what erudite students much impressed
is the culpathon meant to replace the wikithon
no  there will still be a wikithon
the commuters should pay a small residential life or use fee every year like a couple hundred bucks  this would cover the extra expenses of cost
commuters already pay the student life fee
all students  including commuters  pay a student life fee
but why would you need swipe access to a dorm you do not live in  if are visiting someone
i would immediately think of printing in residence halls or computer lab access  eg  hartley  between or on the way to classes
would you want to only have swipe access to the dorm you live in
to be fair
uh
but gs students do nt  we share what our activities fees pay for with the rest of you
carmen   seriously

i do quite like the idea of bwog writers in 09 tricking bwog writers in 15
my youth betrays me once again  we updated the post removing the linked april fool s post  god bless the institutional wisdom of the comment section
i actually really enjoyed this post good job bwog
i agree  this is a smart one  once in a time
will anyone have extra commencement tickets in may
as a matter of fact i will  give me a ring at 212 372 0850 and we ll talk it over

you forgot the story about how one of the tennis coaches bought him a new putter since he heckled the opposing team at one of the away tennis matches
doubt that s true  come on now  give him some credit for having school spirit and actually supporting our athletes
hey harrison
incomplete sentences and broken links  tsk tsk tsk
yet again
is it really true that it is common practice for girls to eat in bathroom stalls  i just can not believe that it is common to override such a basic tenet of common sense as the separation
i am genuinely curious about this  can anyone at all attest to doing it
brad garton is the man

the way to stop laptop theft
is this a joke  this is theft
dear bwog
does this mean we should preemptively grab girls  butts if they re wearing short skirts
you know  to prevent rape
can we stop with the silliness we know you love so much for just a minute
what is this
this is totally inappropriate  public safety does nt have the right to take and tattoo  my computer because i step out of 209 to go get coffee or go to the bathroom
quis custodiet ipsos custodes
watchmen or juvenal reference  this being columbia
i had my laptop stolen by public safety on friday night  when i tried to retrieve it
you could press charges  theft is theft regardless of whether your property is returned
doubtful re charges  the issue is that we probably gave up certain rights upon signing up for columbia ids or access to butler  something like that  or the public safety person could say it was unattended
instead of wasting time taking and then returning your laptop
i would do it if the nypdpublic safety did nt plan on performing what looks like a fourth grade art project on my  2
idk these things freak me out
perhaps i m a fellow prude
wait
sexual harassment  vaguely amusing cakes
different people have different standards  it s othering to deny their experiences  it can have an alienating effect to be exposed to things like thatdid i do that right  can i skip the workshop now
can someone explain
uaw is the union that has organized many other graduate students at public campuses across the country  also
let s just say
also
students need help and direction for filling out applications for rhodes
why the fuck should the opinions of alumnae who will literally not be affected by a change in policy in the slightest be more important than the actual trans women who are currently excluded from all the town halls  why are we letting people enforce their bigoted views of what it means to be a woman just because they re alumnae
apparently everyone who disagrees with you is  bigoted  no matter what
probably for the same reason they d consult with alums
barnard students are all invited  obviously you are not a barnard student
is this harmony
you re back  i m glad you ve safely returned from another dangerous journey
is the blue space ship looking for harmony hall i actually heard it is 110 109 street
i do nt know what this is
wife swap  is nt that what professors do on sabbatical
does anyone else find it hypocritical or at least a little strange that bwog condones rape fantasies  and you ca nt tell me that i ve misinterpreted when the image posted above includes handcuffs
consensual kink  sexual assaultnot that 50 shades is a good guide on consensual anything
who cares about 50 shades of grey
hi
i wan na have threesome with the girls  ladies

as a transsexual transvestite mother of 3 young gorillas i find natasha s willingness to go out with anything very refreshing

you two are more than welcome to sit on my face

threesome
threesome
is the pairing of these two together in one personal a reference to the classic french erotic novel limage

yes tat
this sokolow guy s head on a stake would be the most beautiful sight right now
why
i m confused why after 550pm the time starts going backwards
the name lion tamers is pretty condescending to the student body  sounds like something they would have had at my elementary school
i do nt know
still no daily beast huh  cool tech
bwog is the worst
beware  the back of the but is large but there are few entrances and exits  it is very easy to hide something in those dark recesses but not trivial to get it out
surprisingly accurate

that li swag tho
is the second one being ironic or no

benjamin franklin  i would ve picked alexander hamilton  he s the real hottie
can we just take a moment to laugh at the administrations stupidity  they want a 30 second to 5 min video for the art part of the the sexual assault mandatory stuff
can we take a moment to laugh at the author of this post s stupidity  i bet she goes to barnard  it s funny how now that she got everything that she wanted after terrorizing the campus and bullying paul
if this programme seems rushed
interesting observation  demonstrating compliance with various legal regimes and evidencing an intention to overhaul compliance programs tend to be effective in corporate settings where the corporate target is cooperating with the government  cooperation entails giving up individuals within the corporation that allegedly contributed to the culture of disregard for regulatory requirements  these remarks reflect the current setting for corporate interactions with the sec and doj regarding substantive offenses like wire fraud
to the people critical of administrative responses like these  what actions should the administration take
i do nt find the administration s response to be so objectionable  but i would say the most justified response would be
barnard students are not columbia university undergrads
actually
sorry
i invite you to the university wide graduation ceremony
separate president  separate board of trustees  separate school  for the record of the schools typically included under the columbia bubble
there is conflicting info on this in emails officials send out but nowhere on the columbia site does it give an explanation about barnard officially
aka not part of columbia officially
by the way
if you are a senior and you do this
ssgbm
that s one hell of an autocorrect
that s not what personal means  or attack really
gsas students have to do this as well
jesus
well let s see  columbia has been around since the year 1754 since that time
creates kneejerk program in response to something completely fabricatedthinks this is ok because there is still a  conversation to be had
this will feature a howto seminar   what to do if he does nt text you back
very othering to asexuals
where s my free pizza plz
is nt the band the group that does the heckling of the other teams
did emma accuse him of rape
i m started to get annoyed with all of these anticolumbia things  bollinger s administration has admitted that they need to fix the system and they have made some big strides in doing so  why does nt no red tape propose some legitimate soltuions instead of attacking their own school and trying to make us look worse  being belligerent does absolutely nothing to fix problems
i m cringing at these rape terrorists  when is paul s fucking lawsuit  these people need recourse
someone commented this on emma s public facebook status denouncing paul lolgreatest  response  ever   below are reasons why your claims remain dubious1  paul  small shindig in our room tonight  bring cool freshman  emma  okay so let them know i ll be der w da females spon  sic   in this conversation one day after the alleged rape
you and that commenter really do nt even try to act like you re part of the columbia community
bwog is part of the problem more so than anyone else  at least
did you read the letter
do nt these idiots have ethnic studiescomp litanthropologygender studies classes to attend  or have they figured out an even more absurdly easy way of getting their columbia degrees
good to see that bwog is reporting on this
wow  what a bunch of selfserving idiots  this is so disturbing on so many levels  if they think columbia administration will bow to their pressure
i ardently support freedom of expression  while i do nt agree with premise of the protestors  ie
i think it s ridiculous that they think that seminars are needed to prevent rape
i agree
i agree with you  they should be expelled  unless they were  raped  at knifepoint
fantastic plan
it s me again  my husband and i were at the session
hi nicole
anonymous
and
being a  smart girl  does nt preclude someone from being sexually assaulted
i pursued  and won  a case through the university  my attacker was forced to withdraw from columbia   and believe me
that  nicole  is nt who she says she is
did you text him  i love you  the next day  no guest pass to the state of the union for you  move along
despite the fact that nationwide and columbia statistics prove campus rape is rare
among the demands    interactive prevention education workshops about genderbased violence that all students are required to attend at least twice per semester  that s rich  i barely attend class twice per semester  sorry nrt  going to have to pass on these  workshops
this really angers me  nrt should nt get a free pass on disruptive and frankly obnoxious behavior  these students should be punished to the full extent of the disciplinary system
what would columbia be if it were not for small groups of students occasionally going on personal crusades with inexplicable zealotry and brandishing badlooking signs and looking like it s been years since their last shower
holy shit this is not okay
caltech students once messed with prospective mit students
these people are a disgrace  nrt should be kicked off campus  harrassment
i can not wait until emma and zoe graduate and we can get our campus back  they have taken over and terrorized enough people
do nt forget bwogs role in this  bwog eats out of the palm of their hands  they never even published coverage of the daily beast article  the editorinchief is in cahoots with the rape terrorists  evil
lmao all these commenters talking about  our  campus who clearly are nt actually studentsoncampus  no crown   go back to the spec comment section where it s at least a little less obvious that you do nt even go here   looking at you  nicole
well no shit  nicole  is nt on campus
these guys are so last year and it s sad  emma
they need to chill  prospective students should not be subjected to this
sexual assault is indeed a serious matterdid any nrt members consider that this sort of disruption can be extremely triggering
not a fan at all of what happened
there s nothing wrong with nrt providing information life this for prospective students
i went to dartmouth for a preorientation info session  kind of like our days on campus  and there was a similar student group protest during one of the events
no red tape are terrorists
so you are a wasp
first off
she s not a wasp
aine rocks
i would nt date any girl at columbia and especially not at barnard  you d be in tabloids branded a rapist and her a hero faster than you can say  false accusation
i am certain the cb ladies weep for their loss
aine is an irish queen
lactose intolerance is a deal breaker for me
i think you misunderstood  what redeems you as a human being
nah did nt you know she created nature and boxed wine
she s the heiress of the franzia fortune and owns every tree not the eastern sea board
this sexual respect shit is so dumb
but it s really

kyron griffith literally beat bobby fischer and now coaches carmelo anthony at chess
has degenerated into a fullfledged nutcase  you can namedrop once he beats magnus

fischer is dead you buffoon
yay  this is so cool
does matthew michaelides still play
columbia university is best in the world in chess
you know the manhattan school of music is only like
no
i do nt know how i feel about this
but you know bwog s standard is one of fair representation and openmindedness    so it s just a mistake that this read as sorta voyeuristic  in a bad way
your trip to the orient seems quite marvelous  i do hope the savages didnt follow you back to civilization  though it is good to know they are already christian  curiosity temporarily abated
how brave of the journalist to make a foray into the lands of the lesser people  perhaps if we make them offers of food  proper food like we eat

you could nt have asked someone of korean descent to join in on this  i do nt think finding a columbia student able to go deeper than yep

provides a generous stipend
so
the document says the budget for 20122013 and 20132014 was  21
hehe  parliamentary debate recommending 21k and getting 7k
mock trial gets 21k  teams are about the same size with similar needscolumbia debate is ranked 8th in the nation and has the 5th best duo in the country  a pair also advanced to elimination rounds at the world championships  one of only 8 us teams to do so   unlike debaters from basically all other top us universities
team a gets  x means team b should get  x is nt a good argument thoughin 2013
mock trial does nt get 21k  mock trial requests 21k
everyone asks for a whole lot and gets less
actually a really good job at transparency

can you do this  not like the brazen giant of greek fame
malia is black
she s also a legacy at princeton and harvard  i m not so sure that she ll end up wanting to go to columbia in any case
legacy for undergraduate admissions only counts if someone s parents went to the undergraduate division of that university  so
or taking malia to look at colleges
did they just get into separate suvs  lol
she is not michelle   she is the first ladymrs  obamamichelle obama

is the daily beast article
biased is this organization  they published everything that she did for over a year and attached links to articles in major publications  why wo nt they publish the link to the one article in which he chose to defend his position  maybe she s a friend of the editors  are they members of the same organizations
still nothing about the daily beast  this is getting embarrassing for student journalism  sheesh
seriously
offtopic
cool story
when someone has never actually won an argument in real life
bwog
the db article was misinformed and deliberately pushing an agenda  es released annotated screenshots to jezebel  within context her messages make perfect sense  frankly
point is to publish the article continue the conversation instead of ignoring the first article in which he defends himself
its actually not the first time he defends himselfdid you not see the new york times article
the daily beast article
what the hell is your problem  get a life and stop obsessing
that bwog posted every article that made him out to be a villain for over a year  now that he has defended himself and they do nt want anything to do with the story  why  what is their agenda
i m sure if you were receiving death threat s
how telling it is
did you actually just favorite that comment  you guys are so pathetic
hahaha  needed a good laugh at this point of my day  excellent story
calling rosie odonnell a celebrity is like calling emma s s accusations true
it is a shame that the identities involved did nt remain anonymous  i do nt subscribe to the idea that it s wrong to ever question allegations of rape  due process requires it in my view  but i do think that it is wrong to question or denigrate such allegations publicly  what if you are wrong  granted it was the accuser who made the allegations public  this is a good illustration of why that is a bad idea
you posted every single thing that she did over the last year and a half  all you have to do is create an article saying that this is his side of the story  but you wo nt do it  why  post the daily beast story
biasedbwog
track  glad you think your own question is great
are you him  but anyway
in the past day we ve seen articles on some random professor who does nt even teach here
majority rules  post the article
did it ever occur to anyone that a huge percentage of israeli jews are arab and that hummus in israel is thus not appropriation as a result  this is just another misguided way to portray israelis as european usurpers that have no connection to their ancestral land and region
ur argument is stupid bc obvi if israel is claiming it as they re own they re not recognizing it as arab
and yours is stupid due to a lack of grammar and not acknowledging the fact that the arab countries do nt recognize israel as having it as a national food as well as themselves  they claim monopoly on it but are nt willing to share it with those with arab identities in other countries
you are imputing an overly strict mutual exclusivity to the categories of  israeli  and  arab   plently of israeli jews come from cultural origins that
you just wanted to say garbanzo
so
is this an onion article
actually  no
it s because he was denied tenure
ya know  as big of a son of a bitch dorian is
you  and those who favored your comment  respect a decision by a person who is angry at a group of people who have power over him
and how does not posting a grade for labor and politics yet harm anyone  it s not like a currentprospective employer or a graduate admissions department is dying to see that you understand the intricacies of labor s role in american politics  seriously
he did submit the grades weeks late last year when i took it too
cp time
that s such a shitty thing to do to hardworking students
he s hot
he is being denied tenure exactly for actions like this and stunts he has pulled  this is inexcuseable  he should immediately be repremanded and discipled by the department head
i love you paul  where are you
not relevant  or are you incapable of reading what this bwog post was about
you re in college and still talk about sat scores  grow up and move on
do people know if he was actually denied tenure
so i took this class  dorian warren was denied tenure because of stunts like this  i ve heard rumors of a lawsuit brewing because he did nt fulfill his contractual obligations  i hope columbia wins
lol dorian was not denied tenure because of  stunts like this   he was denied tenure for being outspoken in the media and deviating from the department s bland and ubertraditional branch of political science and polisci methodologythis stunt  is super lame and extraordinarily aggravating
roosevelt club on campus loves this dude and all he does is suck a big black dick
but bwog is getting more interesting this semester
people are turning every comment thread into a stream of rape accusations and counter accusations
seriously
has anybody heard anything from this guy at all  are we just guessing that he s  gone rogue  because he has nt responded to attempts to contact him  do we know that he s alive  is he ok
is there any way of checking on this  if it s not malice
he s been on tv multiple times the past few weeks and is active on twitter
if he were white
if he had published original scholarship
love the explanation of the ar grade   given to students as a temporary grade in circumstances when a students irregular academic behavior in class merits something other than grades a through f  surely no professor would ever do anything wrong  i m not in this class but i have had two or three things professors who did absolutely insane things  like skipping my oral exam
what the hell does that have to do with this article
was this a reply to a comment about the article about mattress girl s alleged rapist  if so
do nt we do it all the time though  texting is a great way to avoid peopleto people you never ask to hang out with
according to her annotations to the conversation
no daily beast coverage
yesss i want a bwog post about it so we can have a discussion and know who s actually commenting from campus versus who is just trying to bombard the comments after being linked from an outside boardsite  which is what happened to the spec op ed
does nt fit with bwogs  all men are evil rapists  narrative that they ve worked so hard in constructing
thought no  1  maybe instead of protesting against teach for america

it s delusional for you to think that an a recent grad with little to no teaching experience can take a 5week crash course and effectively teach in a classroom more importantly
several points i want to make in regards to both comments above  for the original post  liberty
1 columbia is getting too predictable  the daily beast could make up headlines and we d eventually just back into them  example  concerned columbia students think greek life is disrespectful to actual greeks during period of financial uncertainty blah blah blah  2 the best teachers have made the biggest difference in my life  perhaps just a bit ahead of the contributions of my own parents  i think it s fair to say that tfa probably not so inadvertently finds great
tfa has more diversity than this group
yes
except for the fact that veteran chicago teachers perennially hold a gun to the mayor s head
and how do you think these lowperforming schools hire teachers without tfa  they do the same thing as anyone else
publish the daily beast story
i agree
articles have you posted about her activities and her position  i believe you even had a link to the article in the never biased ny post  so put up the link the daily beast article and let your readers see the other side of the story
i entered the room covered in mahogany furniture  interesting mental image

publish the daily beast story

we want the daily beast story
remember consent is the most important part of getting it on this vday  and also every other day all the time forever

i stopped reading after  athletics   too bad the fball team ruins it for everyone
did i miss when bwog started using the word  football  to refer to our team again
i think when mangurian left
with the current climateculture here
publish the link to the daily beast story
considering how much attention bwog has given to emma s account  most recently featuring her attendance at the state of the union
must be friends with her  you got yourself involved in it bwog  you published all of her activities and all of her articles  publish the daily beast article
that s a lot of cook books and previous editions of people and us weekly magazines
i fucking hate you and i still died laughing
construction will begin march 2016
you are correct  the article has been updated to correct the error

never got that email  also that s from last year it seems

it s a commentary on the duality of man
props to eric cohn for covering this important news on his birthday
this is also probably a list of sachems
glad to see students finally standing up for themselves when the administration screws us
yea that ll show em
student leaders throw a pissy fit and then go back to sucking up to administrators
do you ever talk to people or just catch snippets of conversation from afar
i m so sick of administrators giving students token input
my comment got an award
congrats

robert kraft is a columbia alum
the reason professors generally object to a later drop deadline is not
we need to understand if profs are going to be unfair graders
ok
the normality of a distribution does not imply a particular mean value  in fact the grades of many classes are normally distributed
the real issue with this comment is its explicit recognition that students decide whether or not to take class based on what grade they believe they will achieve  any initiative to delay the drop deadline would only encourage more students to decide their schedule based on their anticipated grades
i certainly agree with you that students should try to step out of their  comfort zones   i believe this precisely is what the lengthy drop period and the pdf policy facilitates  more opportunity for students to test themselves beyond what they would otherwise would  the reality is that many are gradeconscious
oh dear   would otherwise would   you know what i meant
fucking frogs
are you sure it s not yipoon chiem
this was great
i am so sorry for your injuries
i had gone to work after the first accident had happened
do nt take questions in the comments without your malpractice lawyers present molly
good luck
best of luck to you
i had one formal interaction with dean hinkson in my time as a student and i could not believe that an adult
molly  if it gets bad enough and you feel like you can and should you should sue barnard for endangering you  the school failed to warn you of the potentially fatal sideeffects  if financials are a problem most lawyers would take this case on a contingency fee  they only get paid if you win   just an idea  i am so sorry you have to go through this  get better
i think this is a bit of a stretch  increased risk of seizure and having sustained a head injury are both relative cautions against using bupropion
i know that the universities do nt like students soliciting individual donations from alumni
who thinks
people say we have no sense of community here
i have to agree with the op
i m tempted to feel the same way  but at the same time
this is a very sad situation  but if i got a random email from someone saying they were also a barnard student and soliciting money from me to help pay their medical bills
only cc and seas students gave her money  lol  nice generous barnard alum
bwog
i agree
this is really sad
i take bupropion myself
i think for me
i hope you get better soon molly  i made a contribution to your fund  sorry you were not treated better by some  and others who only saw negatives
bwog is still the fat kid
hey  fat kid rocks  well
i thought momma bwog and bwog were the same

was there an email sent to students about this  i did nt see any communication or maybe i m just dumb
wow
what s really telling is that info about this meeting was not distributed to cu students and no official email was sent even to barnard students
if yore so concerned about the email

i hear he is applying to barnard
i had no idea people from sweden were swissbwog

comedy
when was the last bwog post that was actually reported
prezbo s feathery hair extravaganza  and open forum  i think
for real  bwog has become a piece of crap
bwog gets a lot of shit but i applaud you guys for stepping it up and going in the right direction
to be blunt
thanks bwog  appreciate thishow much do you focus on journalism and reporting vs being just a fun blog
this is a nice change in tone
2 minimize harmshow compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage   i think you meant maximize bwog tries to make everything a scandal see  their pathetic obsession with shit talking sororities
not sure i saw how the quotes helped explain the situation at all
what the fuck did i just read
this is the high quality satire we know and love from bwog  seriously though
does paul nungesser have a litigation fund to bolster his case against emma sulkowicz and columbia  i d like to donate to his cause
i do nt think this is satire  study abroad is one of the biggest scams of the modern university system
yeah  i did a semester in roliskia
as someone who moved from europe to nyc because of columbia
you know
but seriously
i very much agree with this piece  i personally chose not to study abroad for many of the reasons listed above  i m from a rural part of the us
foreign pussy is the best
honestly
i m pretty sure this is nt saying  do nt study abroad  it s saying that it s ok if you choose not to  that s all
there s more to the world than western europe
blasphemy  i deserve the right to subtly deride the privilege of others
i feel like the prevalent mentality on campus toward studying abroad is  i do nt want to because i do nt want to miss out on what s here   that s a dumb reason not to go  the opportunity cost is not that high  most of you are much more likely to live in nyc again than to be able to take 5 months off to travel and engage with another culture in a more meaningful way than a tourist  if fomo is the only thing stopping you from considering studying abroad
eta  and also not wanting to  that s a valid reason not to go as well  i just meant to say that if you re considering it you should nt let fear hold you back  i was pondering going for a whole semester and almost did nt go since i was so afraid of missing out on certain classes and friendships  that s silly
new york is amazing
all i get from this article is that going to school in nyc is basically studying abroad in easy mode
do you get a refund for the difference in tuition  even if on finaid  if you study abroad   ifso ill definitely study abroad
i
while studying abroad can cost a bit extra out of pocket  depending on where you travel
the performance is today actually
oops  changed it  perhaps too late   merci

this is good  btw
i think the sic referred to the  th  preceding it
only 40 hours a week  dude what s your job
do nt forget the dragon lore books in the old gaelic section of the stacks
this is the most redeeming post bwog has put up in a while
i do nt think there s anything wrong with any of this advice  of course if you want to read in the library all day there is also graduate school  anyway
i agree with the general sentiment of this
i actually appreciate the selectivity because it makes me feel like it represents something i can do
i work a 45 hour week and i have way more time and leisure  and dispensable income  than i ever did at columbia  also i d rather chat with time warner for an hour one time than give up a week of sleep for an exam any time  the postgrad lifestyle has its perks too
do nt mean to diminish the message of the original author  you should totally take advantage of collegethe freedom of youth while you have it  but postgrad life is awesome  just sayin
i vouch for this
some of us are already balancing 30 hours per week along with a full course load and the work it entails
yes
all that heteronormativity seems to be your choice
read bwog
great story   youth is wasted on the young   students at columbia do not know how great they have it  with brilliant students and profesors and opportunities abound  endless libraries and cultures and courses  you will never have this chance again  enjoy it
i understand you are feeling nostalgic right now  probably because you are working a bunch of hours at some entry level position
i can also vouch for the fact that postgrad life
some of us just ca nt get laid
dean kromm is one of the most caring
you kids forget so easily  was also behind the potluck house guillotine removal and black lives matter banner removal
kromm is one of the worst administrators at columbia  she actively tries to get students in trouble by stalking social media
she has been responsible for ramping up alcohol enforcement  how dare she   i mean
so we spent more millions on yet another hiring process
nothing about storbeck
is an evil witch  i hope she and her whole family get mad cow disease
really
stop posting bad comments sucking admin dick
ftw
is there a third party litigation fund to support paul nungesser s lawsuit against emma and columbia  i would like to invest
please help them
is there a kickstarter to aid paul nungesser s lawsuit against emma for damages  i d like to donate
only the spec deal in absolutes   from a certain perspective
why is everyone in this so damn sexy
julianne moore def deserves the oscar after this performance
kinda in love with the scene w keanu and lara
the falling car at the end

this is a new loweven for bwog
they were starting to hit a stride back in novdec
r u sure this was nt grindr
accurate
the word  srat  is an adjective
no you re an idiot
no  it s a noun  as in  i do nt give a srat s ass about any of this
bwog reeks of hate and bitterness
let s be mean to the pretty girls because they re pretty

so bwog is favoriting comments from its own staff
is bwog all over making fun of greek life this year
why are you so obsessed with me
i m in love with this
and this is why nobody asks bwog for advice

straight creepy
a more lowkey atmosphere for a campus celeb like peter
you re forgetting popcorn at jjs
reality check here  ccsc does not  campus celebrity
why does this exist it is not even funny
peter probs commissioned this himself  his ego doe
i m not even a sjw
this is awesome  hopefully this leads to some productive discussion and the creation of some impactful programs on campus
yay  more programs we do nt want that cost us even more money and still do nt work  this school fucking blows  how about a why the fuck did fall bacchanal get canceled committee  or a what s the deal with grade deflation committee  or even a why does that columbia admin spend 90  of her days with her thumb up her ass committee
thanksodessky
it would also be nice to include the st johns nyu dual meet this weekend for the fencing team

what if i fall for a barnard trans and we go to have intercourse and there is a penis dangling there instead of a vagina  was this an issue of concern discussed  i felt i should ve been allowed into the forum as i am someone who will ask the pressing questions
if you are going to accept a small subset of men
the line is cis men
so feminine men can apply but masculine men can not  how can you tell that on an application
you ask   are you a woman   if the answer is no
so
lol at universities in 2015 that are still gender segregated
why ca nt people have alternatives and variety  why must all universities have the exact same communities  what s next to go
alternatives and variety play themselves into a contradiction here

why was nt this sent to all undergrad students  deaths of individuals in our learning community
3 undergrad schools and an affiliated college
i got it
only liking this for accuracy

emma was so upset that  no one seemed to know who i am   poor thing  really let her down
did your teacher make you watch the sotu last night and write a report  i m glad your parents let you stay up past your bedtime
why is this even news
it is news  nungesser said to nymag   i voluntarily let myself be interviewed by da chief of sex crimes at svu in new york city
pretty sure any columbia student being invited to attend the president s state of the union would have deserved a bwog post
not if they blatantly lied to get there
don  you mean  allegedly  lied    unless you have definitive proof that a rape did not occur  which you do nt or this would nt be such an ordealalso
yeah
emma sulkowicz goes to hamdel

good god
secret service confiscated my matress on the way in   matressgate
is the mattress to show that she sleeps around
obama put it in the butt for me afterwards  satisfying trip all things considered
the tone in which this piece is written is ridiculously inappropriate even if emma s visit ought to be a news item  which is also debatable    gillibrand also pushed obama to include emmas story as a segment on the issue in the state of the union address  he did not    it seemed as if the only thing obama neglected to talk about was the reason emma sulkowicz was there  sexual violence on college campuses    while it may have been disappointing to not hear the president speak on sexual assault on college campuses in his address   seriously   who wrote this piece  it reads like a combination of a minor political party press release and a pta newsletter
thanksodessky
k
oh hey
she is in it for the attention  she was nt even raped
note to gillibrand  have you no shame  do you have the faintest notion of due process and the value of a reputation  by giving credence to sulkowicz
mattressgate  sulkowicz very well knows that tracey emin has made millions from this sort of  conceptual art
this is 100  objectification  they re being treated like prize pigs at a state fair
i agree with the  vaseline on every body part
wait
this is amazing
not true  livestock at a state fair is mostly left to its own devices
emphasis on  361 days of the year i do not care what you wear   sorority recruitment keeps being taken completely out of context
you are definitely a selfselecting group and you obviously have the right to wear what you want and look put together  that is your choice
food for thought  are you a 50yearold conservative on facebook
since you are nt in axo and are only hearing what jezebel and bwog choose to tell you
what about nonwoc who do nt want to do their hair  is this easement only allowed for them
i think these are the criticisms that people inside and outside of the greek system should be making
while i do agree that there are criticisms to be made of greek organizations as a whole
first thetagate now poor axo  never forget racist theta
jezebel is for the lowest common denominator of pseudo intellectuals and serial activistsprobably barely even makes it into emma sulkowicz s favorites bar
i do nt see the problem with having to get the clothes months in advance in the case that people would have to returnexchange them  i do nt see the problem with wanting to look your best for something that is probably the most important event for your group  i will agree that there is an issue with the whole  natural looks not being polished  but i m pretty positive this was just some naive word choice  this is in no way comparable to theta s fuck up
i like hottt girls  when and where is recruitment
poor axo  by no means is this as bad as theta appropriating culture  their websitetumblr instagram has hardly any diversity  theta is racial point blank and i would join a sorority where appropriating culture is  fun
killing yourself for axo recruitment must be what being on columbia football feels like during every practice
if it were actually a football team it would be columbia
why is this news
nongreek  ok lol sure
can someone explain the concept of paying to have friends  not trying to be rude
the problem is you are under the impression all a sorority is is social hour  we do more than just socialize with each other
agreed
not a superfan of greek orgs in general
like anyone joins a sorority for its philanthropic projects
while i m not mad at the accusation of  buying friends
yes
and then
it s true that many go through sorority recruitment without knowing anyone and are somewhat blindly committing themselves to an organization they must pay to be a part of  however
it does nt matter that this is axo s handbook  it could have been any sorority s handbook  the fact is that this kind of handbook is reflective of sorority recruitment on a national scale  it s archaic
for real tho  if any axo girl wants hit me up i do nt care if your hair is like you just rolled out of bed heres my number 2126631708
why is this so scandelous  if you were going to interview for a job you were really interested in
i approve
typical emma
what s one more liar in washington going to change
sulkowicz will blend in nicely  lots of pretty little liars there who made their careers on falsehood
esc
excellent point
vodkawaters  recommended in the end
wow i know none of these people
i m not a senior
probably because you had your head up your ass protesting
i think it s because these people live in the butler stacks
these people do nt even go here
max nelson is the best  3
grant king grantikinnn
absolutely none of them
i ve never heard of you either  and yet
because they were studying for four years
whoa there  that s pretty offensive to people who studied relatively diligently but were nt in the same social circles as the pbkers
what do social circles have to do with anything
if you have nt heard of someone
apparently i know none of these commenters

first post of the new year 2015   best to everyone
presses charges to publish her exboyfriend   rapist s  name to the world
it s time for the wall of shame
though   but check ssol  i did nt get a notification email for a couple of mine
aaaaaaaahh
great coverage of the game  it was really ugly  but
how it s okay for chinese people to say horribly racist things and no one says anything because we all assume those robot sub humans do nt know any better
asians get discriminated and stereotyped every day and there is no one to stand up for them
snaps
pandering to activists  yawn
how about next year s terrible horrible nogood fall academic schedule
i was going to be all  back in my day  about how fall 2011 exams ended on the 23rd
how about  what does that asterisk mean
the manhattanville benefits are well published
is that your baby   man with baby strapped to his chest
no idea because i was sitting in the back of the class and she had recently lost her voice
project management is a real bitch
seriously
bwog
should have filled out the evaluations  sorry
mudd
nussbaum got rid of all of the mirrors
two nypd officers were assassinated while everyone was back home
the wall of shame is an important tradition in the columbia community  way to drop the ball on one of our most outstanding forums for public shaming and community outrage
here  let s build our wall
the carleton dining hall
came out
where
this list
see under  existential    what do you want to do with your life
yeah for most of us that s not an existential question but rather a looming future one
thanks  this made my day
have never heard of this guy
gs really has the best deans
i freaking love dean harford    this article shows why  the most awesome dean and professor ever  gs is so lucky to have him
jenny slate is not an  alumni  she s an  alumna
was a spy
bless
not funny  bring us more of those videos instead
realtalktho
fucking model un  love you too bwog
take what you can
now very sad  ugh
fuck circa
peter deblasi
columbia is a pressure cooker
yea
qureshi
that s not how sympathy works
le reddit army xdxdupboat if you came here from reddit   berta lovejoy
seem like it was a suicide attempt
he actively jumped out an 8th floor window  how is that not suicidal
there s a lot to the story  a quick blurb does nt tell you much about the situation
no  it sounds like he was high and fell out by accident
if he was carrying a mattress he would ve been fine
but he would have had to pay a fine
i heard he was nude  drugs
he was indeed naked at the time  also
drugs are a helluva drug
he fell out by accident
what  this is an outrage  where is the discussion of the white oppressive klu klux klan wielding columbia which clearly is responsible for the above incident  my  blacklivesmatterblackpanthersunite sources indicate to me that this student
i understand the sentiment
go fuck yourself  the student could die and people have already died from the thing that you re making fun of
why oh why do you have to use this as an opportunity to vent about your personal feelings about a spec oped  a kid almost died  show some fucking decency  you re not funnyedgycool
does columbia not teach trollspotting anymore  get thee to bored  butler
we recently lost a fellow student
drugs
even if it was nt a suicide attempt
i love judging my peers  being sanctimonious is great
get the eff out of here troll
right
does nt wien have window stoppers to help prevent this kind of thing   poor guy  hope he pulls through okay
at last check cu staff are mostly baffled at how he even got out through the window in the first place
yes
they re there for a reason  now to know why  go for a walk or something
you know why
ny post says he went into a girls room and stripped in front of her and she ran out  attempted rape gone wrong
she was asking for it
how does the window open far enough to allow him to fall out
why did he go into a girls room and strip  uggghhh  something really wrong here  i hope she s ok
because college
and read the damn articles  they say what was involved here and it was very clearly was not a suicide attempt
kids  just say no to drugs
i do nt know if this is the right response  plenty of people drop acid and are completely fine  it s obviously some serious stuff
amen
do we know that it was acid that he took
i hope his family is ok i hope anyone who witnessed this is ok
why the fuck do you even care about anyone who  witnessed it   pretty sure the dude who fell fucking 5 floors has it so much worse anything else is negligible
you are not the real emma s
i blame the protestants
i bet he still has to take his finals
i believe i can flyyyyy    r kelly
you re not being smart or funny
at least  emma s  is nt one lying in the hospital bed
he was probably just trying to figure out how high he was
just sent him a care package of some sweet bud  got ta regain that appetite
this is natural selection and deserves to be documented in the darwin awards  this guy does not have my sympathies whatsoever  let s not beat around the bush here  it s time you fucktards grow the fuck up and realize that there are consequences for your actions  you can not just do whatever the fuck you want  you can not do what drugs you want  anymore and think you ll get a free ride  the kid is lucky to have his life and he should shape the fuck up if he wants to keep it  let me qualify this statement by saying this is not my being a troll whatsoever
thank you for being so cleari mean
u mad bro
no
a kid falls out of an 8th story window
hey students
is it just a columbia thing or the academia in general
prof againi said  personal experience with
it s not just a columbia thing  i was at columbia for many years  i am now at another high achieving school  it s welldocumented that smarter people experience depression at higher rate than the rest of the population  at my current school
thanks for writing prof i think that ultimately this post is a great step in the right direction
i do nt make a formal announcement about it
you kids really love to write
on another note
wait are you kidding me  you can not seriously think that he behaved in this manner and fell out a window if he smoked a whole lot of weed  he definitely had to have taken sometime else
grow some balls and go study in the library
lol you guys are starting to act like us now
go away
are you the nypd  because you take my breath away
ill have what hes having
at the moment
must have been one hell of a comedown
we think theyre music  lol
jesus christ bwog get your shit together
wut if bwog purposely makes so many grammar errors to get people to comment on things  jokes on us
does nt that still make the joke on bwog
we think they are music  is actually a pretty chill way to describe a band
thanks for catching that  we fixed it  i must have forgot to put on my own grammar police badge this morning in the mental fog of finals
must have forgotten
achtung  both forms of the past participle
is amazing
sahil has always beenwill always be one of us
hey this is good
so talented
is corey dansereau single
he can carry my mattress any day
did they film this video in ec
really impressive
lies  he always signs off as ek
presumably
hi stfu plz
can primal scream be every night of finals night
we wan na scream and shot
i do nt understand how these questions
this is just terrible
cute puppy tho
today
but if they do nt believe there s a conspiracy
of course the money s not going to go directly to the maintenance workers  it s not like they get paid for each light they replace or each heater they fix  but i sure as hell would have to pay a fine if i broke all the lights in my hallway
no
471 is not that much for an entire organization to have a temper tantrum about  why do nt you just ask emma sulkowicz to make rounds on the morning shows  i m sure she ll make more than enough to let you guys put your mattresses on prezbo s doorstep every night  heck
to be clear
is this a joke  if you leave 28 mattresses on campus
ctw
and if you pretend to be surprised when you get fined for this one
not as if anyone ever had to pay for the holi cleanup every year  you get the idea
holi and carry that weight are not the same
yeah right the holi powder took two days of highpressure hosing  just sayin
dr king filled the jails toward concrete goals
back of the envelope calculation  a basic twin mattress costs at least  57  based on google shopping search results   they had 28 mattresses
the mattresses were donated
as was the money for the fine
snore
stop bitching  your group abandoned mattresses
of course you have to pay  your tantrum shows how irrational you are  you think you re doing something worthy  really  you re not acting like responsible grownup people  you re kids  you dumped 28 mattress  for what  do you think of where those mattresses are going to end up  what about the environment
well do nt you sound like a peach
trying to be kind here  the mattresses should nt be the point  having a big chunk of the nrt statement be  those mattresses were of great emotional importance to us
per spectrum   the fine was paid for by ultraviolet
i m sure they think that the stunt was clever
i started to reply to your comment w facts but then i finished reading it and realized there s no way someone so dumb actually exists and you must be a bored 11 year old troll
my mom waited until fall movein of my sophomore year to let on how much she disliked carman  her words
oh no
john jay is the smart choice  you can head back to another building after you trash a carman suite
fig d it out already  nice work

twin peaks yasss
kornet wld b proud
please keep your creative writing aspirations contained to your workshopcongrats on the sylvia plath reference though
why do people like you feel that it s necessary to belittle other people s work  congrats on being a dick though
you hurt my feelings
i thought it was pretty entertaining and wellwritten
can i get a second nose on this floor
furnald master race
you chose carman  you could have gone to wallach and lived in a hotel with granite
yea that place is a shit hole but get ready for mcbain cuz its even worse  jah bless that i m over that
how could you not have asked her how to pronounce her last name
emma is literally the most positive person on this campus  columbia will miss you
she seems nice
meal plan for 4 years is the biggest of turn ons  the food definitely has improved every year
i love this girl s thoughts  i love meal plans
what  this is outrageous  she is not black     this is the oppressive white racist supremacist ku klux klan hierarchy of the conservative institution columbia  named after the demigod of white oppression
is wrong with you
uh
terrible satire
emma tuz is perhaps one of the greatest
what about the fball team

why was this boxed  even dumber than a legion of feminists carrying mattresses to support an unsubstantiated claim of rape
artwork expands the asshole  correlation does nt imply causation
based on context
damn it all
carol
so much inorganic
love u cuss
lara
paper topic  why are women superior to men
sexist humor  is nt this reverse racism
this was actually really funny
bwog  partially  redeemed with this vid
bwog is back
this is amazing
boob pics plz
yeah its really not that big of a deal she should just do it
perv
i ca nt stop watching this  please do more of these
in luv with alex
alex hastings is my favorite grl on campus
i need more distractions like this

the guy who mouthed the first bit of dialogue pointing to the sign was really good for some reason
alex hastings is a goddess
alex hastings

cute boys in this vid
who is the motherfucker that is downvoting all the comments    reveal yourself  we will hunt you down
yes this is the bestlove this story
this is the best thing to happen to bwog in a while
to the dismay of horny women and men everywhere
shit
just when i thought you could nt be gayer
seventies therapeutic bullshit
man
and it is the sovereign duty of the whites to help them reach their potential
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh        wecomefromthelandoftheeiceandsnow    if we re going 70s
is that happening bwog
not something i usually comment on
the pillow fight is only in the spring
that beta is going to pull their typical shit tonight
few minutes  we ll see
what shit does beta usually pull
i was maybe five blocks away
we are all too obsessed with ourselves   all
so this is what life is like when you do nt wait six hours between meat and milk
so this is what life is like when you can afford to constantly eat outside of dining halls  forreal tho how much   this person spendin on food every week
yah for real   screw the kind of person who eats their roommates food  especially when they try to justify it by saying you can eat theirs sometimes too  like screw you it s not like i can make a meal of your pudding cup snacks
so this is christmas
is she writing from the future  today is friday and it s not even 5pm yet and she has stuff written down for friday night
chiddy bang is great
do people only listen to one song an hour
does anyone know if alums will be able to attend bacchanal
sorry
assuming its like any other oncampus tic event
this is on the second night of passover  oh great
i m not jewish
the problem is that the performer wo nt be drake
no bread  no beer
looks like it s going to be a literal bacchanal for jews  wine only  maybe rum too but that seems like it could be complicated
bad move moving the date up  too cold for the crop topbro tank wearers at least
not only is it yom tov
uhoh  april 23rd is take our sons and daughters to work day  let s just move the whole thing to may
fuck authority  fuck the system  i love bacchanal
but get ready to pay the tic processing fees  so not quite free
oh look we are discriminating against jews i bet our campus will come together and protest this sarcasm
please move date back to april 11th   holding it on easter weekend will cause both christian and jewish students difficulty to attend
i heard it was tupac
to meredith
you were there
how bourgeoisie
shakur s agent just confirmed he s headlining bacchanal
i do nt know how well bwog takes comparisons to other sites
this actually made me laugh out loud  more like this please
karen you are the strangest human i know
why were the baby bwoggers anonymous
i do nt blame them
i ve seen a couple articles comment on the presence of public safety at orgo night
instead of  more cumb antics after the jump  it should be  more to cumb after the jump  get it together bwog
the climate towards law enforcement in the usa has never been so fractious
well
anybody else think cumb played it way too safe this year after the editorial was published  felt like they spent the whole time proving they were nt racistsexist etc
the jokes were decided and largely written long before the editorial was published  orgo night writing begins about a month in advance
can someone honestly please explain to me why protestors found the need to interrupt midnight breakfast  and surprisingly not orgo night
because black lives matter
lol k
well guess what
check your privilege  none of those groups experienced centuries of oppression at the hands of whiteoldmen  how could you be so insensitive
are you kidding me  jews  2000 years of oppression and exile
yes
itssimple    you still did nt answer my question
blacklivesmatter  even if we have to disrupt fun and get in the way of people s commutes and lives in general to be heard  if you get annoyed by us you are part of the problem
but i think that pretty much everyone at barnard agrees with and understands that black lives matter  instead of protesting against us
butbutbutyou re a troll
where s the video of this year s orgo night   it s still not on the cumb youtube channel
the authors refer twice to  the fight song   but cu has three fight songs  i have no idea which one they mean  the band typically plays  who owns new york  when it arrives and departs
it was  roar lions roar   i do nt know any current student that knows any other fight song  most do nt even know the words to that one
beta should play this instead of circle of life  just saying
though the deans may come and go
how was this joke inappropriate  it broached a difficult subject but its purpose was obviously to criticize columbia s formulaic response to these tragedies  you ca nt even honestly say that it  made light  of the issue
that was well intentioned but seemed to be in poor taste the way it was delivered  however
meanwhile
i do nt think you know how this works
i agree but i feel so torn about how much slack to give them after they handled the last suicide in a really similar way   according to columbia
but what else did the administration do
fair s fair
can we talk about how midnight breakfast was protested but not orgo night  literally everyone at midnight breakfast already agrees that all lives matter
orgo night was protested  the second part of our action was to ensure that the marching band would not come onto the barnard quad  protesting in butler during orgo night would not have been smart
here s what i do nt get  why do you get to make that decision for the rest of us  i respect your opinion
perhaps because we were out there  if you had an issue with  us and our opinions  dictating whether or not cumb could come into the quad
and how were we even supposed to know that anything was happening  to be honest
if i had known we were supposed to meet to make that decision maybe i would have come out  you have valid points but you turn so many people off with your activism that it s soooo hard to support what you re doing  i m not an expert
you know
literally fuck off  please copy past the quotes from the above script that are other  isms  and the jokes are nt even made in the quad  literally what are you trying to prove
have you literally even seen the band play on the quad  all they play is music  no jokes
wow just so we get the language right  you re throwing a hissyfit over a fucking silent sitin
a fb friend on mine posted a video of women eating at midnight breakfast with a caption deriding those choosing business as usualattacking your friends for eating waffles at midnight before finals instead of ineffectively protesting some large amalgamation of issues  yeah
this is a good point  they have excellent reasons to protest
they seem like they want to criticize the same things as student activists
what was that line that mikhail said was a double entendre and that took everyone a while to get
we in the band dont pretend to have all the answers
angrysenior i m supposed to be concerned about ensuring that you get to have your stressfreeanxietyfree time
if you re protesting the band mentioning subjects that can be triggering in an event that everyone can easily avoid
this is essentially the equivalent of you saying that no red tape should nt stage protests against sexual assault because they will trigger people with their protests  so then what do you want us to do
nothing
oh well     cantstopwontstop
keep protesting  you do great work  but do nt criticize cumb for triggering when you do the same thingif you re going to say cumb is bad
confused by what you mean when you say proof  how is the simple fact of marginalized students feeling insulted not proof that cumb  insult the marginalized   i still fail to understand how our protest being triggering is grounds for it to not happen  yes i understand that the entire spectacle of it could have been triggering
also love that the joke about the  aimlike style of a disorientation guide page  is the only one that you reference
confused junior
i did not say that you re saying our protests should nt happen  i m addressing the fact that orgo night should nt happen
then why do nt you go protest orgo night if you have such a huge problem with it  oh because of  the police outside of butler   so you re crashing somewhere else where there are nt police  i

maybe nrt should nt be staging huge protests in the middle of campus  i ve been to their protests and they were far more distasteful and triggering than orgo night
you sound like a cosmofag  are you a cosmofag
i am completely open to saying that i am ignorant
1 using the word  slave  objectively as if it a  encapsulates the identities of enslaved people and b  does nt trigger emotions for people of color who continue to befeel suffocated by the same institutions the us was founded ongenocide and slavery2  insinuating that transgender women have  dicks  puts the complex identities of transgender people into the overbearing and fetishized shadow of genitalia
i have a real question about 1  i thought this was actually a keen commentary on how black people are treated in today s  postracial  society  i mean
i thought it was a poorly writtenbadly connected joke about unpaid internships  work like    a slave    and all you get is college credit and a letter of rec
i cant believe people were not offended by orgo night  the marching band made light of very serious issues that survivors of rapesexual assault and people of color have to deal with every day  to minimize the suffering and oppression of entire groups on campus is despicable and should be dealt with by the administration
you are acting like this was a mandatory event for students or something  if you dont want to go
basically you are saying that some people getting a laugh is more important than the subjugation of entire minorities and oppressed peoples  im not trying to ban laughter
the problem with your argument is that you are acting as if you stand for all poc
i never claimed to speak for all poc  even if some poc feel uncomfortable
tracked
kind of confused on how you have time to argue with yourself right now  do you know what finals are
yeah what a tool
it was nt mandatory
cumb was not making light of anythingpublic demonstrations and outcries are nt the only ways to bring attention to these issues  satire
i really do nt see what s so hard to understand about the fact orgo night can not be seen as an alternative activist measure to  public demonstrations and outcries
given that the band historically has played in front of several residence halls
dude you re arguing with a troll right now  check the track button
i ll just recall this line from the varsity show senior year   columbia is all about students with different viewpoints coming together to be offended
wasnt there
i think they generally do punch up  i just do nt get how they think they can 100  absolve themselves of perpetuating any harm by using a liberal platform to hit targets like admins and racism while claiming immunity to criticism by any of their peers  they say it s serious satire and then go
can somebody please remove this stupid comment  meaning this one
no more jokes about serious topics  they are not funny  that is why the producers
that s it
meanwhile
how is columbia a racist institution
barring any specific allegations
columbia is a racist institution in that it uses the category of race to determine who gets into the university and for what
i disagree
can somebody remove this disgusting comment
can somebody remove this ignorant comment
laughter therapy is so real  thank you fellow sufferers
does the carry that mattress thing apply to finals as well
bwog
that s not the full film
boycottorgonight
but there s so much material to work with   trayvon brown riots
we should all organize a rapein to protest the event  i m sick of cumb marginalizing minority majorities with their joke rape
lolz
boycottorgonight
so whats the deal  is this still happening
yes
if you want to boycott orgo night
why in the world people are asking to cancel orgo night  i ve watched the old shows
clearly
is sarcasm even a real rhetorical device
shhh now
the most insightful bwog comment i ve ever seen
the reason why most columbia students do nt like these extreme leftwing liberal activist groups is because they are oversensitive about the stupidest things
yes
yesshould we ban cards against humanity from dorms as well  we have to reduce the risk of people offended   think of all those poor columbia undergrads
the discrepancy in scale  individual unit within confined space vs collective student body in public area  makes them different cases  calling for a bit more sensitivity is just a matter of playing more nicely when with other people
i get what you re saying
very well put   and i ll use that door  thing  that was top   this thing is nt new i d have expect someone who  did nt like it last year  to go maya peterson on the next one
you darn communist you
you sir
news fucking flash
there is a difference between being offended by a joke and not allowing the idea to flow at all  was i offended by the isis posters and does it trigger awful memories if they were to mention 911  of course  but
everything is fine
appreciate the alternative perspectives  good to learn about the other side
can orgo night please not be in butler this year  if it is
highly offensive that you would make light of this critical issue  you are a class a felon and a racist  go away no one wants your input
meanie
i get sensitivity  i was an ra  i ve written people up for bias incidents  i understand the fever on campus about the tragedy of sexual assault  as a man
oh my god
when we gon na find out about pbk
can someone verify is carry that mattress thing is still happening
when can you resort to punching these pussified oversensitive liberals in the ovaries   violenceistheanswer
fraid not  info desk for trolls is closed
that has to be the most unclear hashtag i ve ever read
keep it comin  so excited for parts 5
who even knows how long this exciting tour might continue  i sure do nt
welcome taylor
i really enjoy these historical romps
thank you
smoke a fat j
seltzer water
the institute for contemporary psychotherapy at columbus circle  they are really good
hey bwog
so excited for part 4
so some of the plutocrats got girlparts  meh
corporate feminism at its finest
is it me
back when the news of manhattanville expansion was fresh
my god that was painful to watch
i m torn
the business school is awesome  underclassman smell  this video is amazing   hihaters
sexist  just another reason the male sexodus movement is in full swing
you must be fun at parties
while i applaud the effort for student input
then please use the online form  ninety percent of students and alumni are against this
it s great cause 2 am is usually the time i realize that not only am i capable of staying up all night
you re either eighteen or on a whole lot of adderall
sometimes it s just that your body does nt let you
this is better bwog
mrs claus
remember last time bwog reviewed
yes
wow  that was certainly   trying to think of a nice way to put it   a thing that existed  yeah
this is so long
why is half of it about vshow
xmas was formed completely separate of the varsity show  it actually began as a production through the group nomads  the vshow  xmas overlap is generally because of the fact that they re both original musicals
that xmas and the varsity show have no official affiliation  to call it  the fall counterpart  to vshow is a bit presumptuous  while many of the same people are working on both this year
it is a discredit to the months of work these people put into this show to spend so much of this  review  speaking about another show that is unrelated
the music by sam balzac and fernanda douglas was the best part of xmas  9  they may have been underserved by the at times clunky directing and choreography
sounds like someone got rejected by the varsity show
madison seely did nt write the show
no
bwog s twitter   remember the nutella scandal  how that was the worst thing on campus  we kinda miss that   africkinmen to that  what a semester
this was really shitty of beta  this week of all weeks
the biggest squids on campus pretending to be the frattiest
but   squids
indeed
who s the kid in the video
on the class of 2017 page a beta brother called someone who complained  hypersensitive   they are officially the worst
would nt say  the worst   just really awfulthe  i m gon na call a lawyer   shtick is nt endearing at all
said complainer previously threatened to  burn beta
all over some latenight disney tunes
beta s drunk tweets that were deleted this morning   libel   law  a published false statement that is damaging to a person s reputation  a written defamation    betathetapicolumbia   columbiabeta  are you willing to back this up under a libel suit  betathetapicolumbia   columbiabeta
also
hey man
so where should i live next year if i do nt want these shitheads to wake me up
live on the side of watt facing 113th  of course there is partying on some of the weekends
this  sig nu parties are normally broken up early and even then they do nt blast music just to be annoying as they are always getting noise complaints from the grad student housing next door
thanks anonymous  rising junior here
you never know about your chances
but i want to give a moment to talk to beta as if they cared what nonbetas thought   though
even i ve never been on this website
i would assume this reply is nt from the tim paine that is beta s webmaster
the same things are on the local columbia beta site  seen that one
i d also assume that beta knew what
psh  do you honestly believe a bunch of drunk pissbabies are actually going to uphold the bs moral codes fraternities supposedly stand for  institutionally
well honestly
hey everyone why dont we start a  dicks of beta  twitter and when they do this stupid shit just post pictures of them so we can shame them as a community
i think jp would like that
everyone knows you re the biggest tool in beta  why have nt you graduated yet
now
with all the credits he s raked up
relevance  seriously
maybe if you spent a little less time and effort on waking people up at 4am and a little more on your pathetic recruitment posters and nsop party apps you d have some members with enough class to know that shit like this reeks of tryhardism
sent 2 noise complaints to public safety when this shit did nt stop in the first 30 minutes  next time i m calling nypd directly
was gon na rush but nah fuck that

just goes to show how sheltered the columbia community is  beta is being just as bitchy as they always are
as i understood it
my frat could beat up yours
all your dicks are gon na get flayed  dead
it s disney music guys  yeah some people got woken up
all nice and quiet on the ec front
i had sympathy until i heard the woman s voice  sounds far more annoying than the music
kdr
my beta experience was not perfect
dude
give
call the 26th precinct  212  6781311 when this happens again

what was the criticism for the  party like it s 1889  theme

let s travel back to the year 1889
k
good explanationit kind of wipes out any concept of doing a retronostalgiaetc themed event
do nt fool yourself girl
no
i guess the students do nt realize columbia has been dealing with political issues of the times since 1754 this is nothing new
concerns were raised about  celebrating like it s 1889
males feel marginalized at barnard
many talked about having to choose between activism and schoolwork  i do nt understand the choice  you re at school
no
possible repost because i forgot to check the  i m not a robot  thing
that would be great  as someone in a similar  firstgen college studentbroke as all getout  situation
glad that sga takes it upon themselves to create this important space  clearly administrators need to be pushed to change
the furman counseling center is open from 9 5pm every day  today  1210  and tomorrow  1211  there will be walk in hours available from 57pm in the furman counseling center in hewitt  in addition there will be the usual listening hours from 7930 pm on thursday in elliot hall

the point is that they did nt elect an eic
ugh
partly why alumni were happy
this is kind of misleading  before 138 there were 4 directors in the business section on mb

although i have nothing against ouimette
agreed  above all else
he went to dalton  he can write
english as fuck
do you mean involved in content period or writing for content  because plenty of previous eics have come from nonwriting sections
what the fuck does this have to do with rape or black people or both
hush
that the reason no editor in chief was elected was at least partly because people did nt like the only person who was a contend or and so they abolished it rather than let him win the position

the fact that bwog favorited that comment reeks of desperation
yesterday
why are you linking fox news i thought bwog was at least slightly better than that

is nt it in poor taste to post something on sylvia plath today  also none of this is at all funny
sylvia plath was and is more than her mental illness
why d you remove the name of the person that wrote this
yall have too much free time
no  this is important  it s about ethics in game journalism
come on
ehh
i understand your sentiment
so the new editor wrote this then removed her byline
this is done in such poor taste
students who are seeking counseling also have the option of requesting a one time appointment to get a referral to a therapist in the local area who will provide therapy that is covered by their insurance

thank you   these are fantastic
whatever it takes to get barnard students out of butler
no scrubs pls
you say you ca nt live with what you been through well
replacing barnard s library with a building that can hold even fewer books makes absolutely no sense  who is making these decisions
i bet there is plenty more space for administrative offices  that s the top priority in academia these days  not books
the involvement of librarians in the planning process is hindered by the recent resignation of dean of the barnard library and academic information services lisa norberg   lisa has nt hindered librarian involvement by resigning  however
i thought the whole point of building a new big building was to make the library and study spaces larger  it is already one of the smallest libraries in the nation for a top college  this makes no sense  plus no room to grow  is barnard now going to completely relay on columbia s libraries and study spaces
rely  no wonder you go to barnard
yes
please stop your pmsing
hey  it worked  the menstruation process just stopped entirely  thank you
from my understanding
while utilitarian
it also fits into a whole theme that does nt reflect well on this decision   girls do nt need books
top college is a big claim to make  barnard is top 100 or 200
faculty need to shut the fuck up
this sort of silliness about building a  150 million smaller  for books  library will be the straw that breaks barnard s back  dspar going and announcing the plans to build it while literally saying  we do nt know how we will pay for it  is the last step towards the end of barnard as an independent college  financially or otherwise
that was a while back
do nt be naive  nothing is figured out  this is about raising money and not in the best interest of the school academically  it s the bottom line and dspar s legacy of raising money and building a building
came to barnard for the  barnard experience  advertised to me in high school  would have chosen a different school if i knew that experience was a liecame here for a small liberal arts college  take 100  of my classes at a major research institution because barnard does not offer the classes i want to takebarnard is selling a lie  merge or be honest with prospective students
yeah i chose a small liberal arts school and was surprised to find big university bureaucracy
barnard does have some of the small school benefits

colby college s miller library and its  renovation  devastated the campus with a majority of its collection sent to storage

are you fcking kidding me
why would you think that this is okay    who raised you
accidentally upvoted  that joke was uncalled for and disappointing
bwog  for the love of god
what did it say  i m curious
forget it  the apple pie query is betterwritten and more interesting
you are a star
as a board member of nrt i applaud this article for describing the genesis of our organization
you are a weird group because you are exclusive  you need to fight to protect both victims of sexual assault and those who are wrongfully accused  but you do nt care about the other side of the coin
the police do nt fight fires  the ambulance does nt arrest criminalsdifferent groups do different things  it does nt mean they do nt care  is it  actually that hard to get
awkward because nrt does not have a board  also this comment makes no sense   byetroll
it s not enough that we ve been bombarded with articles about this issue
it s not enough that
except
thats how they get views  get used to it  i ll leave you with this quote   it read like a rape written by a feminist novelist or something  every single part of it fed so perfectly into every feminist trope
was no one from casv willing to be interviewed  so much for transparency in student government
this is nt an article about casv
was no one in casv willing to be interviewed  there is a lot to say about their organization s methods as well  how they got the editorial from spec endorsing their list of goals in september
hi sejal   tracked
my comment did nt show up the first time i made it  no need to be a snippy bitch about it  and i am by no means a sejal or casv supporter
hallie
such an interesting and insightful article
she is already a senior editor
misspelled names in this article  maybe somebody should fix that
please stop grammar raping bwog  you impose a norm on bwog which it rejects  it s about acceptance
grammar raping   seriously  we re adding  rape  now to everything  that s how  hip  that word s become

incredible article and so wellwritten  awesome job
amazing

i understand your sentiment
how about promising to not be a huge dick and look to give points instead of take them off before taking more of our money
this is nt about you and your lousy grades  tas and research assistants need this
how did he die
i honestly did nt want to be the first one to ask
suicide  they re going to keep happening if the environment at this place continues to be this shitty
i agree  i m a first year and i fell into a very dark place  counseling services helped a little
an unfortunately perfect example of the point you re making  when i read  15 credits  i scoffed
this is so true  needs a box
it s also up to us to make this place less shitty
our culture it s eats own in order to support the already established hierarchy  it s sick but it s true  the reason this culture is so strong at columbia
eats its own

that s fucking awful  screw the nyp for cutting down something so terrible into the lurid details without a compassionate voice
nyp is trash
who can i complain to  that article is so fucking disrespectful
i feel the same
but is it worse than our administration trying to cover up suicides out of fear of bad pr
these emails have never mentioned the word  suicide
is this really the right context to say  deantini
we agree  we ve made the change to the post
the man s a piece of shit smug bastard anyway
there s a time and a place for wacky nicknames
well
true
we really need to evaluate the mental health on columbia s campus given that this is practically a semesterly event always around midterms and finals which
i hate that gpas are the currency of selfesteem  gpas dont matta in the grand scheme of lyfe
if there were nt a bullshit curve and grade deflation
i agree with you but a lot of those are seasspecific complaints  columbia college has lots of grade inflation
it may be seas specific
no listen
9 cce sucks at helping students find jobs in a variety fieldslocationsand if you complain
suicide rate of young adults  1524  was about 1 in 10

that does nt really change the fact that it s a tragic thing that we should look into the sources of  in fact
sure  i m just saying this is nt a school crisis that we need to investigate immediately and that is threatening to decimate the student body  it s tragic
maybe instead of  after the jump  bwog could say  click the link  when the article is about suicide
thank you for pointing that out  changes have been made
that link still says deantini
empty cache
awful  how does one make sense of this  it seems like he was very involved on campus  is there anyone here who knew him who can share a few personal words about him
my sincere heartfelt condolences  as a college community we must remind our students to help their fellow students and seek help if someone is suffering or distraught  i am saddened beyond belief
this is horrible  my thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family  whenever i get an email like this announcing a students death
i think this speaks to a broader problem on campus
that s absolutely right  i never know what the heck they re talking about when they say my requests for a two day extension or to submit a paper the first week of june upsets the academic integrity of the college  i m not asking the professor to go easy on me in grading  all i m asking is for a little more time to get myself together so i can finish the class successfully  instead
i can speak to similar struggles with the administration during my own darkest time  last semester i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety that manifests itself with extreme fatigue and an accompanying lack of motivation  this condition went undiagnosed until the spring semester of my junior year largely because of mono during my freshman year and several actal or perceived illnesses that were often times caused or accompanied by depression and anxiety related symptoms that i did not recognize because it did not fit in my limited and ignorant definition of depression  perhaps my pride kept me from realizing the extent of my struggles or maybe i just wanted so badly not to have a likely permanent
my condolences to his family
i would like to draw attention to that fact that all of the community involvement they listed was for queer groups on campus  while we ca nt assume that he  they   preferred gender pronoun check someone   was queer based on this involvement
this is one of those times
i m so sorry for your loss
i am one of the mentally ill who was so close to committing suicide during my time at columbia  my student adviser
to emphasize one of your points
per dean valentini s email
fucksorry
there are people being triggered all over campus right now and the best they can do in offering a  safe space  for everyone is to put out some cookies and hot chocolate like we re at fucking study break  does this school even care
is that even a question  everything sucks right now
what do you suggest they do
when i went to the carman lounge
i miraculously surived a suicide attempt here and am very saddened by this
i agree  i too felt really alone and wish i could ve spoken to someone who understood  feeling suffocated all the time is awful
great idea   i d join in
actually  and sorry to double post
alum here  one of my friends at columbia committed suicide during his junior year  he was always smiling
another alum here  please feel free to reach out and talk  ask for help or advice  whatever  i m happy to help find resources for class work or point towards the right organization or administrator to talk to  or if you just want someone to talk to
yes  students with mental illnesses need to organize  we can find inspiration in the victims of sexual assault who said to hell with the stigma  we must make demands on columbia
i think this is a great idea
there are a lot of people to feel the similarly at this school but are too cowardly to do the act  i am one of them  this place is dark for me  i have no friends and i suffer from depression
major typo here  i meant many people who feel similarly
i suffered with ocd for 7 years before i was able to get medication  the moment i started taking the drugs
suicide is not an act of bravery  your so sounds abusive and is actively hurting you  being in a bad relationship makes mental illness so much worse
semester off saved my life
that is absolutely not true  you are a loved and valuable part of this community and columbia would not be the same without you
i promise there are people at columbia and elsewhere who love you  i really
i read his twitter posts  he said  there s so much disgust in the world and its just getting really hard to deal with it all  it s just enveloping and heavy   and  jesus fucking christ  i m done being sexualized   i do nt know josh or what he was feeling  but from my own experiences as a gay man and feeling along these same lines
thank you
came back to read this article
also
where is the mental health taskforce at  what is the point of all of this administration and bureaucracy if it does nt fucking do anything  this place is beyond repair
those are fulltime students juggling work
i was once at a small dorm party and once the conversation turned to school work and stress
i want to form a student advocacy group to address mental health issues at columbia  can anyone who is interested in helping email me at cumentalhealthgroup  at  gmailcom  i understand that we re all in the middle of finals
what happened to the student wellness project  they ve been awfully silent today
i did nt know josh villa
josh was a kind and thoughtful person and he will be missed  my thoughts are with his family and friends  i would ask that if anyone knows someone who may be under a great deal of stress please reach out to them and let them know that you love them and that you genuinely care about their wellbeing  if you are in crisis please know that there are people willing to help you  if you need immediate help please call the us national suicide prevention lifeline at 800273talk  8255   life is rare
i do nt really have much to add to the convo but like other is the comments here i ve also been severely depressed most of my time here and close to suicide at several points  this school is a terrible place for your wellbeing and i ca nt imagine having to navigate it as as a qpoc
columbia university
harvard only take 4 courses per semester  at yale
josh was an amazing person  it saddens me that i ll never see him again but all the memories i have with him will last forever  the last time i saw him was a couple days before he left to columbia in the summer and it sucks knowing he s gone  i know everyone he knew loved him and had such a great personality  everyone will miss him and i really hope his family is doing okay  i wish there was something i could have done but all i wish now is that he s in a better place  he was such a great friend of mine all these years  he ll always have a place in my heart  i love you josh  you will be missed
we sent our darling joshua to columbia with hopes he ll come back on break with great stories on how much he loved it
just no
how dare you make light of a situation like this
what is wrong with you  rip josh  you will be missed
sometimes it s laugh or cry  even if attempts at humor are crude or inappropriate
in response to  how fucking dare you
can you please stop hyperanalyzing someone s death  have some respect and keep your coldhearted speculations to yourself
this was in response to the dude who gave the five paragraph bipolar manifesto
looks like they removed that comment anyway  it was bad
wait they did nt let white people take part  that s probably the most preposterous thing i ve heard since the vagina monologues saga
if you are not with usthen this is not for you
read the article again
it s shameful that this article has nothing to do with rape  at least vagina monologues was topical  prayers for my sisters at uva
attention whores
how is columbia participating in the police state  columbia invests in prison companies  columbia public safety works with the nypd in the project to criminalize black and brown people in west harlem in order to displace residents and expand the columbia empire  as an elite college within an incredibly unequal education system
do nt make this a columbia problem
so if you re mad about it
i agree with your conclusion but for different reasons  columbia is obviously a terrible institution that contributes to the marginalization of the most disenfranchised people  but that is nt even actually poc it is women  all of this talk about police officers killing blacks has distracted us from the issue of police officers ignoring and contributing to rape culture  mike brown and eric gardner were rapists and you mourn them  when a nonfeminist
instead of contributing to the distraction which is the  diein  i am pleased to announce that noredtape has organized a  rapein  details will be forthcoming but it is sufficed to say that we anticipate about twice the turnout as this shoddy die in  also if you actually care about the advancement of people of color you would know that the first thing that must be accomplished is the liberation of women  once feminist principles guide the world racism will cease because first and foremost racism is a symptom of the patriarchy
ca nt even tell whether this is a joke  maybe i ve been at this school too long
here s a few ways to tell this is a crappy troll  nrt  a group i m not in
you mean to say the rapein is not actually happening   damn
do nt play
wait
no they were too busy with their internships on wall st
they participated by handing out fliers  participation and support can take many forms  also this is nt about white people
yeah of course
it s actually about justice
and justice ca nt involve white people  do nt you think excluding the white race just perpetuates inequality  is nt it a little ironic
it s actually about ethics in game journalism
is that a problem
is there a problem
while it may be awkward to state that whites should nt take part in the actual diein demonstration aspect
thank you
nice save
thank you  as a black person who heard about the race restriction
yes
no this is completely different
as to the assumption that all racebased classifications perpetuate inequality  imagine a movie theater that historically admits whites only
god  it s really taken all semester  at last something i can fap to
i too enjoyed segregation  lets bring it back
they left us dead
no they did nt leave you  dead
but why bother a columbia tradition uniting communities  do it at a police precent or downtown  allow stressful columbian to enjoy something  i felt it was very inappropriate and i am a high supporter of the movement  disappointed in their attention seeking
it s not the holidays for mike brown or eric garner
this is such a dumb comment
i m sorry a black man murdered by police brutality interrupted your yule log ceremony
pigs who killed mike brown  eric garner  just find it annoying how these two deaths are grouped together  eric garner is a case where the cop clearly killed someone for no reason
calling the police  pigs  really raises the level of debate  glad columbia students understand the nuances of the situation
disappointing  terrible judgement used by these guys
police protect and serve
i hear that at harvard
then why do nt you go to harvard
i do
yes
your facts
your facts
boston  harvard
confused where asiansmixed race people fall in this  maybe someone part of the movement could clarify
they do nt

hi  so the information posted was nt a mission statement at all but a simple text  either way
organizers made it very clear that any selfidentified person of color may participate in the diein as long as they were comfortable doing so
organizers made it very clear that any selfidentified person of color was welcome to participate in the diein as long as they were comfortable doing so
the movement does not care about asian americans  we are simply supposed to keep our heads down and do our work as model minorities  and be ok with prejudices because hey
not form discourse   but the asian political collective and the asian american alliance spent all that time on the forum about two minutes of a play maybe 400 people saw  honestly
i suggest you check out organizations such as caaav
ok so we ve established that there are advocacy groups for blacks
how could you guys make one of the best traditions at columbia about something so negative  it was one night where the columbia community could rejoice in the holiday season and come together and just be happy before finals  what happened to garner and brown is extremely saddening and i understand we should be aware of what is going on around us especially in this city
or maybe issues that involve the safety and wellbeing of every individual in this country should take precedence over fun
okay
an alternative might have been to think
or maybe recognize that a lot of students ca nt rejoice or function or live because of this decision and how if affects them  and how those students wanted you to be aware of that  thank you for continuing a tradition and for your work but calling protestors assholes and not seeing the bigger picture reinforces why this happened when it did
the protest was nt disruptive at allit happened once the trees were lit  after the speeches
but just like you said
students of color worrying about being alive in the next week  how about you do nt rob a convenience store or sell illegal cigarettes on the street  give me a lot of examples recently of black students being killed mercilessly by cops when they are nt criminalsdid nt talk back and threaten a police officer and i might agree with your overly exaggerated comment  let s be real here
so selling untaxed cigarettes means you deserve the death penalty now
that you feel  talk  ing  back  warrants death is the problemtalking back  really
how about you reveal yourself instead of hiding behind a computer screen  oh wait coward
people like you deserve to be exterminated  white racists    black petty thieves   talking back  and arguing does not warrant execution  neither does illegally selling cigarettes  however
you sound jealous as fuck  it s not about the money
good one anonymous  i guess my description was pretty apt huh  a lil too close to home  what i m actually super jealous of is your baby white pencil dick  is that why you hate black people so much  your lil pecker makin  you insecure  does it piss you off to see black men with  skinny white bitches  that even your rolex ca nt help you get  it s too bad that your boarding school education
you two kind of need to find a corner to call eachother naughty names in or something  it s not accomplishing anything and you re just making yourselves look like five year olds who learned their first bad words
my penis is pretty average
seriously
white allies  because your bodies are not targeted by the system in the ways blk  brown bodies arenot to take away from the significance and sufferings caused by either of these cases
alllivesmatter
it would probably be far more accurate to exclude females
females
all lives matter except female bodies that get raped and nobody cares  this is crazy  one black guy gets shot while being chokeholded by police and everyone goes crazy and they burned down a tree in front of an autozone  but women are raped every ten seconds and nobody cares
i ve been under the impression that more people are concerned about sexual assault than about police brutalityracial profiling  also
so
there is no reason to indict someone who has nt been proven guilty  do you even know what indict means  it s not about proving or disproving guilt in an indictment
i do know that  what i was trying to say was that there is no point in indicting someone with murky evidence that will just result in the person being declared innocent  why would you indict someone with hardly any evidence of their guilt  the witness accounts conflict each other
oh no  what to do in a case with conflicting witness testimonies   if only there were such a process that would allow opposing parties to sift through it in a court of law
i ll respond to your post because i think you genuinely want to understand    when we are going off of our belief that every white cop is a racist pig who obviously wants to kill all black people who are completely innocent  that in my opinion is a silly assumption to make   you re right
i almost started writing a detailed response
i like how you call michael brown a criminal and in the same post say that we re innocent until proven guilty  too bad neither michael brown nor eric garner got that privilegealso learn what an indictment means
continued police murder of black bodies  eric garner was not murdered  murder is intentional  so you think the cop knew garner had severe asthma
you think this is about one instance  you think this is about just eric garner  you think that it is nt also about tamir rice  about countless others  about black women being punched in the head repeatedly on the side of the road  about black pregnant women being tasered because she allegedly shoplifted  she did nt   you think the cops using a move that was banned in 1993 on someone who is saying i ca nt breathe and not stopping because he was on the side walk angry selling illegal cigarettes is nt homicide  you think that breaking down the semantics of a text message that inspired peaceful protests and discussions in an ivy league university is nt taking things seriously  literally get out of here
so this incident shows that the problem exists
anyone know where i can get some good fried chicken
for anyone who has gotten this far into my rant
the police ruled eric garner s death a homicide  calling it murder is accurate100s of complaints of chokeholds are filed against the nypd even though few
your nonchalance about eric garner s death is exactly why these protests are necessary  his life was just as important as yours or anyone else s  but for some reason
i think it s more being upset that we did nt get to have a nice tree lighting ceremony because of your selfish behavior
what s selfish is attempting to invalidate an issue that is devastating an entire population of people just because protesters made you feel a little uncomfortable at your event  also it seems from your comment that you think i was one of the protesters  i was not
loose   chokehold   two words easily juxtaposed when your airway is not restricted
reading what you think about chokeholds is like reading what 10 year old expects college to be like  you do nt know  i know from experience  if you are in a good chokehold
is nt calling all police officers pigs based on the actions of a few bad apples the same as calling all black people ghetto hoodratscriminals because of the actions of a few bad apples  hmm
no actually its not
no
so what you re saying is
does nt he have the right to his own opinion
that is the lamest fallback possible  like
pretty sure they just called the cops who participated in eric garner s death pigs
tree lighting ceremony is super gay  sic  glad it was way more badass this evening
yes

text message distributed by the organizers and among participants
all white people are guilty of opressing poc with systematic
yes
yes  because all white people should be blamed for the actions of the few  let s blame all black people for being guilty of mugging innocent white people on the streets of new york and stealing our bikes
actually
where did the person you re replying to say the heshe is white
yes there is systemic and institutional racism  however
i do nt think you re going to be graduating barnard in 2018 if you re honestly that ignorant and dense
you give barnard way too much credit lol
this is not about black vs white
how long until fox news comes here to talk about the liberal columbia students who refer to cops as  pigs
do nt yall have finals to study
when our lives are being devalued and taken unjustly
k
i m pretty sure your life would be safe in the library
no white people  if not for the white people this  diein  would have had like 7 black people
god
your name is shondrea  lol  sounds like your parents named you with the expectation that you would one day work at a nail salon haha
at least she is nt hiding behind a computer screen as anonymous
you d need a helluva lot of computer screens to hide her ass
ouch  you got meother than the notsosubtle racism
shonni is not gon na listen to your ignorant ass babble from some white privileged and if i had to guess wall street working white boy like you  you ca nt erase our lived experience
got ta love white people pretending to be black womenyour slip is showing
you mean the post by tacoisha was satire   nothing gets past you
but seriously do you dislike pineapple soda
wowfirst of all
racism is not satire  you are an idiot  go read a book
why do some white people always feel entitled to things  it s like you ca nt see past your own exclusion  this is not about you  for once take a back seat and support others
why do blacks feel entitled to government aid  it s like you ca nt see past your own willful unemployment  this is not about you  it s about your five illegitimate children  for once
this is the troll
stop commenting on this article you moronic trolleveryone else  track this comment to see what i m talking about
okay
blacklivesdonotmatter
i m sure you feel very safe
not even clever  you re just an asshole

relapsed into some pretty self destructing behavior since i heard about joshua s passing
eric
yes  went through some of the same stuff  i m guessing this is the same ramon who wrote this thanks for writing this  honestly
thanks for your courage to write and post this  as a freshman who made many poor decisions this past month and a half
this reads like a letter convincing people to keep paying columbia tuition
sounds like someone wanted to bitch  this letter is lovely  so just do nt
given the subject matter of this thread
to elaborate  admitting you need help is not weak  taking a year off on medical leave does not mean you are weak  realizing columbia is not the place for you and transferring is not weakit s just school  not even  the  school
i understand that this letter was wellintentioned
agreed  do what makes you feel fulfilled
irresponsibility is a heavy word to throw at this  the opening states that this letter is meant as an attempt at an outstretched arm
i agree with you
my advice
eric
i really appreciate your letter  as a sophomore
i m curious
i m not sure what spurred you to write a comment like this
i had the same horrible thoughts my freshman year in john jay  the idea that any one person has gone through their time at columbia not feeling inadequate at some point is ludicrous  the danger is when we hide that and put on a pseudoconfident face for the outside world  i went through my freshman year thinking nobody else was having a hard time  that their transition was easyspeak up  everybody has had trouble with this  talk with peers and be open  they will help you and guide you  they ve been there  our fear of showing weakness puts us and others in danger
eric
i absolutely do not want to sound like i m trivializing the pain that so many columbia students go through
what s with all the dislikes  seems like a sincere attempt to reach out
thank you for writing this  i wish someone had shown me this letter before i went to school  before going off to college
coming into being in the world  moving from adolescence into adulthood  thousands of miles away from their families  culture shock  bringing with them their own demons from the past  add to it the outsized academic stress  like a poster said
this letter was a way to let other people suffering know that they are not alone  the letter is not meant to tell people that they should stick it out at this school  everyone has different experiences and different ways of coping with tough times  by criticizing this article you are taking away from someone else s extremely painful experience  let s praise eric for his bravery

bwog
the link to the letter in the first sentence of the last paragraph does nt link to anything
ca nt wait for the band to tell an orgo night joke about this
i do nt really intend to do the orgo thing
now all we need is for the entire football team to resign
rip in pieces pete
remember when all the football team had to worry about was hate crimes  those were the glory days for columbia
wait pitting people on the same team against each other does nt foster a winning program  no wonder columbia had such a hard time understanding why this coach was nt working out
these tweets are hilarious
finally
can we please cut it with the  fball  stuff  it s just disrespectful and unproductive
but they did  usual joke s fball  this is f ball  there you go glad to help
this news makes espn and has less than 10 comments over 24 hours later  got ta love the spirited sports following  i mean
look
in another day
literally just take the tunnel under dodge to schermerhorn
how
because you ca nt take the bridge

all of the science buildings are connected from schermerhorn around to havemeyer  the large building that goes from mudd
what time exactly will the trees be lit  6
great night

530
i thought protest were going to be on the cu campus
i heard there was going to be one of the  dieins  during the ceremony
can someone verify if the carry the bed thing still going on
are people really so desperate to vilify law enforcement they ll protest anything  it s not like nypd beat the crap out of some guy or did anything especially brutal  being in a choke hold for two seconds wo nt kill a normal

clamatics is really a total ripoff of the analysis undertaken by the tuber studies dept  i do nt know why you give these hacks this attention while we originals make due with only our selfpublished research journal
i m so confused
as usual
wait
you just got some ra who wanted to have a little bit of fun in trouble
whoever wrote this gets it  i ve followed these three rules religiously for the last 3 years and look where i am   i m  actually do nt use me as an example
im an ugly dude  not even money and success compensates for it  is there any way to be less ugly
embrace context  one day our skin will sag and our ears will hang low on our shrunken
4 fuck bitches
avoided contentious subjects like israelpalestine and ferguson because my cousinsgained roughly 575 pounds
nerds who for two nights a year get to be bullies  no but really
let s wait for the 10 students on campus who s offended by this
i find making a joke out of the violent murder of people to be despicable  for the commentator who is waiting for the  10 students on campus who s offended by this   if you do nt find poking fun at the chopping off of peoples  heads to be offensive i think it s time for you to reevaluate your humanity
found one
i really wanted a better mattress joke
one of them should hit a mattress as their orgo night instrument
i m pretty bad at keeping up with campus news

thanks buddy
ok
here s another
good thing cumb designs orgo night around your needs
title should be   hear ye  hear ye   your welcome
btw the  your  is ironic
good save fuck boy
fuck boy is gon na be the best superhero movie   in 2015   evil is screwed
it has now been 3 months since your speaking with emma sulkowiczpiece and it s still a featured article at the top of your homepage
you are hereby cordially invited to get the hell over it
ha  radical islam  so funny       11
what the fuck is that headline  does it bother nobody else that  hery  is just not a thing  if your content is gon na be shit  i mean that entirely hypothetically
hear ye
so it s sorta social demented and sad
they re all wired up with just the plug left unplugged near the base of the tree  just saying
social justice feminism with the aims of challenging injustice by putting gender at the intersections and envisioning alternatives
and another great showing by seas faculty
there is waaay too much freedom of expression already on campus
says the anonymous posterto the anonymous poster
is nt this a student run committee  why are they taking so long to meet and act  if the administration took this long on something the students would be rioting
no it s mostly administrators and faculty  the administration is driving the process
enough is enough  end this bilge now  i do nt want my class doors blocked by hooligans  if people want to protest by not going to class
ruppmhad it right  require id entry when protests
wow nice picture guys you drink    you guys are so sick
lol well at least spec has its own  large  office
having shit in an elevator of a publication is better than having your whole publication in a perpetual shitstorm
a speccie
did it happen again
it happened a month and a half ago  dunno why bwog is posting as though it s recent news
this is certainly old news
did nt need to know thiswas nt entertainingmainly insidebaseball pointscoring vs spec   nobody cares about bwog s feud with spec  including spec
bwog why is speaking with emma still featured at the top of the home page  is it the only newsworthy thing you ve done this semester or something
it kind of is
what is kdr
i think it was 80s german elektropop
is carry that rape still going on
yes
you re cute when you re angry  i drink the tears of feminists
i have nt cried in twelve years
i havent cried in 12 years and you cant make me cry    cringe  10
a slightly overthetop post makes you cringe
there s been a distinct decline in the quality of bwog comments over the last couple yearsthen again there s been a distinct decline the quality of bwog
i do nt know about any of you guys
you re not facing up to the real problem
do nt feed the troll
lol
thanksodessky
for the record
this is pretty fuckin awesome
literally came back on here only to see this year s awn greeting
best dean around campus
this man is a gift to the campus
they re so cute when they re all fired up
also dream girl tas
that falls under  things that do nt smell like hot dogs
peetaah mellaark

i love you alina you re my fave
why are there no malaysians
ugh  foiled
and it only took 120 shows    congrats
i can count four pofcs
literally an absurd thing to say  check out 117
this is going to be a rough one to write  rape jokes are not great
there s something humorous about carrying around dorm room objects  it can be done
considering our local tj statue
here s how you do it1  remember that george carlin said he could joke about anything
can someone please tell me if carry that mattress thing is still going on
yas megan litt yaaaas
wow  there s a seas student in there
oh so hidden
if you re considering applying to tfa make sure you know what you re getting into  i was half way through the interview process before i learned  from the internet

the guys playing a muchbeloved disney classic or the guy who wants everyone to know exactly how big his  pea  cock is
either way
angel s penis is all mine  piss off
no
i mean
but because i work on weekends  a working class experience your decadent asses clearly arent sensitive to    can we stop with the whole assumingmembersofgreeklifeareloadedanddontwork thing  seems quite irresponsible  and frankly irrelevant to your argument  to generalize 20  of our student body like that
i think the working assumption is that
i actually think the assumption is that if you re blasting music that loud at 4am
or some of us have time management skills
please get with me please please get with me
pretty sure your signing off with  no homo  is a lot more offensive than those guys playing their disney music
i m pretty sure that was a sarcastic joke playing off the hypermasculine anxiety he s poking fun of in his letter
i m gay  that is all
wtf who is this
no i m the real one  fuck you
will the real jp please shut up
0  100
well i could switch to pixar but its just not as good
but actually this stopped being funny literally four times ago  i might have cracked a smile for like 2 seconds the first time it played  but now i am 100  on board with the molotov cocktail plan
why is this published
wan na rub hogs
maybe it s a  dick  move for beta to antagonize watt residents
this whole thing makes it pretty clear that he s not looking for  complete silence on a weekend in new york city   just some common courtesy
measuring dick sizes promotes a rape culture  hardness of nipples is a much more genderneutral metric
solid title
i m a lights on kind of guy
who has ever called kdr
gdis
who the fuck is kappa
but will either of them point me to harmony
she asked me if i do this every day
we do nt give a fuck
they switch to  let it go
john would prefer that somewhat
how could you say they live they life wrong when you never fuck wit  the lights on
i hope beta plays the circle of life tonight because i m currently dying writing this uwriting paper and could really use a pick me up
lets get some dick pics from beta
i did nt even think any of the beta kids were cool enough to get laid  all frats except aepi  beta
so the challenge at the end is super weird
you sound like a huge pussy
people like you ruin columbia  bitch ass bitch
meant to reply to the original poster
you sound like an asshole
nope  i m a dick  and dicks fuck pussies
the guy who wrote this is a huge asswipe
what if they switch to gregorian chants
really looking forward to the reaction from beta the weekend after thanksgiving  they ll probably be louder this time hahah
carman  if you live there
last year in watt
this never happened
do nt touch my 151 bra
adp
there is a pressing issue  i admittedly get hot easily
bibi and abbas should roll and arafat one and sharetti ll see myself out
that s not maimonides
tricky bit there  halbertal made the attribution
palestinian rocket attacks on israel in the five years leading up to last july killed a total of 11 people  all of them during 20102012  in response
reading some actual ethics literature before spouting platitudes  check this out
this may not be the best forum to discuss current and recent historical events in the middle east
the numbers i mentioned speak for themselvesto pretend that israel s response was in any way proportional
again
if you do nt see your own rhetorical knots
i do nt understand
in international law
jts
go back to your torah umadda
yeshiva university kickin  it old shul
where on earth did i say that  there is nothing disproportionate about shooting down rockets that have been fired at youwhat is disproportionate is killing over 500 palestinian children in retaliation for the killing of 11 israelis  i do nt see how any rational person can deny this
israel did not kill palestinian children in retaliation for anything  israel unleashed firepower on hamas  infrastructure and operatives as retaliation for hamas  acts of war against israel
i do nt remember hamas surrendering at the end of this war  the purpose of this war was not to weaken hamasneedless to say
you are an absolute moron if you think that israelis want war  israelis who want war are to israel as isis is to the arab world  do you honestly think that israeli mothers enjoy knowing that all of their children will one day be soldiers  do you really think that netanyahu
yes
what the fuck is jts
just that sexy
dear anonymoushamas is an internationally recognized terrorist organization  500 children died because hamas cares more about negative israeli pr then they do about their own children  who they knew would get hurt
dear um no
is amazing
nice caption bwog
im sorry but this has almost nothing to do with rape
tell me
damn i wish i were a girl  they have it so much easier in dating  imagine being able to get sex whenever you wanted
not to mention all the free shit  drinks
you re not ontopic   wtf has any of that got to do with the article   you re not posting from columbia   you can tell from the lack of crown logo  you re not funny   it s not even a decent trollingattempt  seriously  take it back to 4chan or reddit mra or whichever forum you go to plot counting coup on teh librals so rush will clasp you to his manboobs in joy
track the comments  all 3 were made by the same person  you are nt even a clever troll
damn i wish dodge had windows and good lighting like in that pic
is carry that mattress still going on
sounds annoying as fuck
gold man sacks sounds annoying as fuck
the best thing i ve read all day  this guy sounds like everything i ve ever dreamed of being
jesus christ
he s prezbo s secret love child
ridge is wonderful  this interview kind of makes him sound more pretentious than he actually is in person  if you have nt met him
ridge was our ra last year in ec  he was very supportive and helped us work through a particular issue with patience and thoughtfulness  he is down to earth and humble about his achievementsthank you
ridge is an amazing guy and one of the most interesting and kind people i ve ever had the pleasure to befriend  all the philosophical waxing is certainly present
there he is
looks like claude frollo from the hunchback of notre dame

but there is a pressing issue  i admittedly get hot easily
went to the first friday show
two hours talking about an hour and a half  is wrong  maybe a minute or so out of that hour and a half will come up during that two hours  i doubt a detailed discussion of how they geared down the production of the  show off  number for the arledge stage is going to happen
i saw the 10pm show on friday night
i object to the idea that the sets  were nt too complicated   that set was huge and more than what most people do in roone so i think that it s a disservice to christina tang to just write off a set that was beautiful as not too complicated
to the entire team  this is the best musical i ve seen at this school   and i ve heard a bunch of people say this as well   congratulations to everyone involved on making such an incredible production
to the props master maddie obrien  this show had some amazing props  did you see that three tiered wedding cake and that painting of mona lisa  she nailed it  rarely do props in student theater get noticed
yayyy rape articles   3
we ca nt get enough of the articles on sexual assault  please do nt ever stop  even when you have tons of other things to write about
bollinger had his way with the ladies at the west end when he went here
it is energy content
good catch  it s fixed
lol
i saw that show tonight and absolutely loved it   i highly recommend you see it
did nt know what to expect going in  but saw it with a bunch of friends and we all had a blast  props to everyone involved
i knew enough about the show  just cast recording
really sounds like they put a lot of thought and effort into this show  and the final product showed  it was original and fresh  not just a carbon copy of the broadway production
those buildings were absolutely spectacular  it is a shame they are gone
ssol does nt even apply to me
actually though
took it with edwards and it was nt bad and i got an a ocaml sucks at first
wow bwog
dumb question
that lit hum is  literature for scientists  already
no  just  no
it sounds like the goals will leave the class pretty much precisely as it is now  i do nt know why the class generates so much controversy
how about resources for the wrongfully accused  or you think that is not needed
i came from a high school that had won something like 2 games in the previous decade
lead   led
good catch  fixed
start with firing murphy and mangurian
i think we can stop with the fball stuff  that joke happened 3 eics ago
yeah  quit picking on foosball
bollinger initially had a hard time understanding what the problem was  after all
why do we even have a team    does anyone go to the games    does anyone actually care    are nt we supposed to be good at school   is nt that the object of a university   learning
teasing aside
any chance rick taylor  former ad at northwestern
because if there s a longstanding problem in the university community that s a major thorn in everyone s side
let s get real for a second  plain and simple
got ta take exception to the  we re doomed
love you luca
turn off the sound
a joyful
whether en ingles o en espanol
i have done a thousand dreadful thingsas willingly as one would kill a fly
this play is metal as hell
so you know
this is a good illustration of why i love this place
i personally thought it was tasteless of them to post so many photos of their collective carry  the collective carry if it was to mean anything should not have been a publicity stunt  which is what it seemed like based on all the photos i saw   do the right thing because it s the right thing to do  do nt do it because you want people to see you doing it
hi
if you really want to see cool ramps
more ramps  seriously  if columbia s basically going to displace half of harlem they should at least make good use of the space  if lerner s ramps creates a places with no study space
one way or another
where is this cold concrete prison located
at least if i fear the tourists i know they just cant swipe inside  so true
wait but seriously though
the college  cc
dean of the college  hinkson s title
are you kidding me  now barnard is conflating itself with columbia college  so annoying
get a rope
if it s a publicaccess event
this disturbs me
pretty sure it s u of missouri not u of michigan
thank you for catching this
no psychology  it s 30 points
you do nt need a major to graduate from columbia  you can just do a concentration
classics would be a really bad major to cram into 3 semesters
word  you also need to learn how to read greek and latin before your points even start counting towards the major
yeah  1101 and 1102 for both languages do nt count
if you re selecting your major based on what s easiest
what
do nt forgot neuroscience
impossible because you have to take 2 semesters of bio consecutively and 2 semesters of neurobio after that
good luck doing philosophy in 3 semesters
just concentrate in statistics  it s literally 6 classes  you can do it in a semester if you re crazy enough
so is that like a high school or something
esc will also be discussing the student activity fee  this will occur during our usual meeting time  930pm  in the satow room on the fifth floor of lerner
how about we just cut the money going to new equipment and facilities for athletes
is earmarked by donors
no it is nt  13 of student life fees  that we pay
yes exactly  what s  9 dollars less
it is interesting to note that if tuition went up another naw 4  everyone would be screaming
sadly
cut all money to no red tape and other activists groups
no red tape is not a recognized student group and does not receive school funding
i watched all three
to coin a phrase
i watched the first 5 seconds of the brown risd one and i can confirm
what is the name of the lead actor  i would blow him till he goes rhapsody all over me
vote on your phone too and then vote on every computer in the computer labs   game the system
where can i get an autograph
does columbia intentionally jam att on campus to prevent cheating
she strikes again
no
carry the mattress thing still going on
what does the last bullet point even mean
you ca nt have an offrecord conversation at an open meeting
you have not obligation to respect that bwog  if anything an obligation not to
if you want to have an otr conversation
off the record  is not a magic word that public figures get to chant to escape coverageit is an agreement between a reporter and a sourceobject of coverageso next time they say  we re off the record
they were going to close the meeting
is nt that messed up too  their hourlong public meeting is a thing they do  if they want to talk privately
would nt want to hurt the chances of ccsc kids that hope to get some glitzy fellowship
who the fuck is giving money to random people every time they hear a sob story  rich kids need to check their privilege
i like blonde hair blue eyed girls
i went to high school with this kid
had us all fooled   how was this even possible columbia
how is this columbia s fault
the days on campus part
columbia s online and pr departments need to be taught how to do their jobs  read the wikipedia entries and the twitter bios
whoa whoa whoa  i can understand the first part
either it was a joke
this article is so wrong it s not even funny  they do nt even know who the real sherlocks are who run this skoolxoxo
um excuse yourself
whoever wrote this article needs to get the story straight  beside missing a couple really important facts
he lawyered up
omg i remember himwtf
what an asshole
he went to my highschool and i never liked him or his smile
this was that kid who made that same stupid face in every picture
lol right
he had us all fooledcheceven made a happy birthday video for me and posted it on quest bridge page and my wall
do nt hide his eyes  let everyone have a good look at this asshole
anybody else thinks he looks like ryan mandlebaum
i went to disney with this kid and he seemed so sincere  we got a flat tire
personal problems and issues should nt be used to justify andy s actions  criminals of all sorts also have  personal problems
exactly  he committed fraud and needs to at least see the consequences he could face if he does this shit again
he went to my highschool  he would even go into my english class and give tips wow  what a liar he deserves this
i had to work all summer to be able to afford my new computer  apparently i just needed to tell people that i got beat up when i was visiting gainesville because i m hispanic  its bullshit that 1  he duped us all and 2  that his friends are defending him by saying its no ones business  they are saying that we are no longer in high school and that we need to leave all the drama behind us  what he committed in order to get his new couple thousand dollar macbook was fraud  a fucking felony  not to mention the hundreds of people that praised him and were envious of his  full scholarship to columbia   fuck him and fuck his friends for defending him  go get some help and get a fucking job  asshole
i also remember that in 9th grade he told people he had cancer
i love dick
i never knew him well enough or really liked him a whole lot but i feel like this needs to be said  this is his personal life and yeah you can write an article on this but putting his picture clearly on this article can ruin his life  in no way am i defending his actions  people change and will change  he s obviously mentally ill but putting this out on the web where everyone will see is too much  how do we even know these stories are straight  how do we know this is not just some person who disliked him and published this shit  i personally know some of these are true but the facts are not all straightdo nt ruin this kids life  how would you all feel if all the horrible and embarrassing things you did were suddenly in an article for everyone to readthis is bullying  just let it go and move on
wow  and everyone at terra made a big deal about it   nice one  mindblown
i knew he was ambitious
i love how all the positive comments are deleted
ongoing court cases are generally not discussed publicly
i knew this kid and i went to islands of adventure with him  he was a good friend of mine during m freshman and sophomore year  this is incredible how someone can be so evil and lie to everyone
played
a personal problem tbh
we shared a smile in homeroom once

alright this is actually zack hernandez who the hell is impersonating me on this post
i came here for the rape  what does this article have to do with rape
bwog  your local trusted source for the best in rape news on the web
i never heard of refinery29 until just now but i m not the target audience
it s a pretty big deal  they re popular with millennials  probably twentysomething females living in urban areas
they actually had an interview with dspar lately
alyssa you are a sweetheart     thanks for making my day brighter every time i see you
she s awesome
you are sunshine
when i grow up i want to be just like you  i coed for your success  proud
the papandreous were planted by the usa to bankrupt greece so as to prevent the russian pipelines and other straits access  just as greece was neutralized during the crimean and cold wars
after odessa
control your freshmen
really
nerdy  stem people do stuff like cure glaucoma
lol at the one person who actually donated to the gofundme page  she was probably that kid who looked up when you said that  gullible  was written on the ceiling
will the proceeds go directly to prezbo  a whopping  5 raised already
700
instead of being jealous bums
i ve had far too many classes taught by tas and grad students  spend some money on expanding the number of actual experienced professors to teach lowerlevel classes
no surprise here
looks like people on here actually life that charlatan  disgusting
tbf i m pretty sure columbia s administration has a legion of underpaid lackeys whose only job is to scan bwog
must be nice to live in a world where the only reason someone would disagree with you is because they re paid minions or somethingevidence to back your theory up would be nice
he s fundraised billions
that s his job
he s getting a raise because he s good at his job
apply an equitable
dude is like 70 years old and that s the best he could do   3 million is bullshit money
another econ major i supposed

i m glad my family s ancient recipe is being put to good use
dirty girls love my dick
what the fuck
what does this have to do with rape
chicken cutlet
morningside drive
this is article is very poorly written and disappointing  rather than entering into any detail on what appear to be well thought out questions  even referring to some as being miscellaneous  the article resorts to quickly glossing over and making vague summaries  the same goes for the presidents  response  if the president was really unwilling to respond to criticisms about the expansion
poorly written   the reporter was just covering the talk  do nt complain about how all the statistics are nt in one place for your convenience after something as lame as one of these fireside q  as  and for what it s worth
yes poorly written  it fails to recognize that the most important part of these chats is not about what the environment is like but rather what is being said  the fact that ms grasdalen did nt think that the concerns students were raising were worth more than passing reference indicates nothing less than a poor understanding of what journalism is supposed to be  i d also note that she is also the favorite for editor in chief of bwog starting next semester  clearly if her concerns with respect to the expansion
yeah bwog probably wrote a bad article because it s racist  that s constructive criticism right there
this was terribly written  she talked more about his hair and clothes and the food than the actual content of the talk and the questions  i learned nothing by reading this  absolutely terrible
pooo pooo poooooooooooooooooooooooooo pooooo poooooooo poooo haha lol pooooooooooooooooo
still talkin  s
how do you live in todays world and not go to china  india  these are basic experiences in bollinger s view
agreed that there was way too much going on that would be better for a light lifestyle piece than anything resembling real news  we know what everyone s wore and what snacks were laid out before show  tell now  i do nt feel betterinformed  less about hairdos
photos
bwog has nt said when these buildings were destroyed
the park place campus was used until 1857
thanks  fixed
man i remember climbing the shit out of that building  good times
one free refill of hot water per order
this sounds like a good idea
it is possible to get around this problem by1  rinsing and2  drying the cupthe cup will then not be wet or dirty
and where do you do that  in one of the clean bathrooms that are nearby
a if possible  so long as one uses a faucet

took a class with mendelson once  it was the worst english class i ve ever taken  so bad  if you re an english major you know how good the department is

wait
so does that apply only to new transfer students
no
when columbia does something for the student community that is nothing but positive
any columbians desiring something to complain about
but i wish they had worked something out for international students as well
we ll just be over here
i ll take a bra burning over their gillette boycotts anyday
dear bwog  i did a poopy in my pants
pericles sounds like a harasser to me  i m a convinced atheist  i do nt need zealot preacher wannabes talking jeebus bs to me on the subway
pericles follows the man down the ramp a ways
was sjp invited to help pay the fine too
the protest groups knew the fee  sws  word
a cursory reread  this is nt the most skimmable thing ever  points up that university event management is picking up at least some of the  500  so we re looking at a 200  decrease and a subsidy  by making sure that the people who had to pick up the literal remains of a symbolic protests get paid for their labor
1  why do u take all admin cost estimates at their word  are you really naive to believe that workers would normally be compensated  50 per mattress moved  the university can make up any cost it wants and then put student groups  in debt  to the point that they are not allowed to do other events  unfortunately
stop shilling  columbia s not worth it  get some self respect
i can remember the tears in their eyes when they said budget cuts meant they could bribe me only enough to say they did nt actually do anything wrong  seriously
if it was so halfhearted why take the time to respond  it s well known that columbia shills
you ca nt just say  it s well known  and then restate your claim  that s not how arguments work  i can say  it s well known i earn a million bucks
does the theory of intersectionality apply to cleaning up stupid demonstrations  come on
sws should pay the fine for a few reasons  a they stand for worker solidarity
exactly  worker solidarity could nt care less that their messes and demonstrations are cleaned up by hard workin columbia maintenance workers  they leave a mess for others to clean

sws was regardless the ones that registered the event and are therefore responsible for its cleanup  would it have killed them to have one member stay behind and make sure that the mattresses were cleaned up  as a result

i am glad that when student protestors destroy campus property
no one destroyed any campus property
another story relayed wrong and blown out of proportion by huffpost  they must not do any research before they post
i loved that show
george joseph writing under a fake name  and culturally appropriating latina identity
their actions make me nervous and have literally ruined my desire to stay at columbia  they bring so much unhappiness to so many  our social life sucks thanks to them
is on daterape  naturally
you assume that the only reason why someone would be uncomfortable around nrt is if they re a rapist  clearly you are not a survivor of sexual assault
that s what it comes down to these days for people like you  we all have to agree
takes most people the better part of a life to get here
one  random post  did nt  ruin my experience   that s not what i said  but anyway  you ve just proven my point  nrt and its supporters  aimlessly nasty and insulting
fuck
you ll burn for this

that s classified

all that talk about encryption is a complete distraction  it s a straw man  we re not worried about third parties spying on us via our google account  we re worried about google itself spying on us  about this
staple the green card to the phd  is a terrible idea  it leads to phd programs full of students who care only about the visaand universities who accept them only for the moneywe re seeing this already with master s programs at columbia
good reporting
omg bwog dividing up speakers by group  but what about intersectionality
free tshirts make me squirt
there was also an orphanage in the neighborhood back then  one of its buildings is still standing
good read  i love learning about columbia s history
i find that many people against shorthand are people with english degrees trying to validate their existence when they know all too well what awaits them out in the world of worth these days
tldr
love these 2
now this was a good one
did you know that every student pays in their tuition over  200 for an athletics fee    that s right
and it also goes to their equipment
the athletics fee is the right to use dodge whenever you would like  believe it or not it costs money to run a gym
would nt that fee also cover the use of dodge for all students
anonymous   true i am sorry but you are incredibly misinformed  i do nt know if you were just pulling these assumptions out of your ass or some other idiot is telling you this bullshit
but at least it s not the entire school
which college is that  home of the fightin  illiterates  chad washington  the football player from columbia college who had to degrade himself by harassing women because he could not get them the proper way and then got arrested
i hate to say this
the greatness that is and was columbia football  not saying this is representative of all the players or athletes on this campus in general  but to my knowledge nothing was done to remove the athletes involved
the greatness that is and was columbia football  not saying this is representative of all the players or athletes on this campus in general  but to my knowledge nothing was done to remove the athletes involved
athletes are the heart and soul of this university  but we ve got a murmur and work for wall street  at least i can rely on athletics to do one thing consistently  no not win
this is amazing
this is wonderfully sensitive and appropriate
columbia s campus
if your parents are arms dealers
because international students on financial aid do nt exist right  the person creating these posts is one self righteous dumb ass
it is true though that columbia does nt do needblind admission for international students  i ve always guessed that one of the reasons we have a high percentage of international students  they brag about this too  is that they admit lots of rich students to offset the cost of financial aid for everyone else
also
needblind
not entirely true  when i applied
it is nt anymore
that s not true
it s true though if you do nt have citizenship you are nt eligible for financial aid  it s also a well known fact that international admission is not need blind
how do i make myself more attractive to women ie less ugly  everytime i try to hook up
you are disgusting
go tell that to all those students from small developing countries who are here on full scholarships and ca nt even afford to visit home once a year
it s just a joke
if this were literally about any other minority at columbia it would get destroyed quickly  unfortunately i know many a columbia student who thinks this way  why reinforce a stereotype
gets offended by the onion because they re dumb enough to think it s serious
its  just a joke  to you because it s not about you  odds are
just gon na say i was on aid but i m not butthurt about the trust fund  bit  it s kind of on point  given the fact columbia does nt do needblind admissions for international students anymore
i find this hilarious  cheer up people
jesus christ
hilarious  i appreciate your humor
jesus christ
bwog
chill
bwog is a bunch of delusional fuckheads under the impression that they possess some semblance of intelligence andor sense of humor lol
the tomatoes and egg over rice is pretty good too
that sounds vile
just checked  that s actually a thing  my bad
stop
but also what is the right way to say that hte combo of tomatoes
or am i being a prick  i dont know
you re right  it does sound pretty weird  but it s literally just like tomatoestomato sauce and scrambled eggs and meat over rice  honestly i did nt have a problem with your comment
try those dumps tho they are forreal out of this world

is this all you need to do to get boxed these days
if there s any sort of criteria or standards involved
great show
adil habib what a heart throb
yaaaaas
this is soooo good  3  3  3
3  3
but where is adil s face
yet another crappy statement by the administration that fails to address their inability to act
oh thats what that was  i thought kids were just sleeping in class after midterms
and all these people are following the lead of the person who has not provided one single proof that she was raped  reported years later  dismissed both by columbia and the police   and who is refusing to bring her case to court where she would have to face some hard questions  the question is why  how quick we are to throw due process out of the window when we re sufficiently emotional about this issue
regardless of what you think about emma s case in particular
i think the administration should nt be forced to do anything  they are not a law enforcement agency
they run a nonprofit
he never said that they are not accountable by law  he said they should not be accountable  there s a difference  your argument is equivalent to telling someone who said that slavery should nt exist that it exists under law
no
can someone please explain to me why sjp thought it was appropriate to interrupt the multiple speakers that were victims of sexual assault to get up there and say that their suffering is somehow understood by the poor suffering souls in gaza and the west bank oppressed by the evil  apartheid  occupation  apart from how terrible it is to compare the pain of a victim of sexual assault to the israelipalestinian conflict
i totally agree i m glad i m not alone  it was so inappropriate to have a man so explicitly describe the abuse of a woman with so many survivors present to be triggered
i actually agree with some of this  the statement was nt adequately thought through  we were under the impression that the rally would be more rooted in the community and why we cared about sexual assault but it turned out to be all for the cameras  oh well  that being said
then why did sjp attempt to hijack the event for their own agenda against the one country in the region that actually has rights for women  just like what sjp did on 911
i assume the reverse works
no  hijacking someone else s event for your own cause is wrong in general
well i know someone who is gon na get a career out of this
emma is a liar
please kick emma and her lies off our campus
interesting  do you have any articles that would prove this  i d be willing to hear
because we all know news articles are undeniable facts
that s a clown question bro
iphone auto correct was not kind to this post  sorry about that
who is going to clean and sleep on all those mattresses  constantly dragging them around is ruining them as well as nicking all the doors
housing has purchased new mattresses in expectation that students will ruin theirs
most of the mattresses were donated and then thrown away by public safety   they were wet and written on and could nt be donated
emma
will the liberal thought police arrest me if i criticize es here as well
carry that weight  really  talk about taking without asking
in their eagerness to protect women in their educational environments
while i support this form of protest in general
if there ever was a reason to get out the vote
prezbo s article is just begging for acronyms  examples   postbreakup behaviors    pbb s  communitybased discourse    cbd  onetime sexual encounter    otse
well
oh
how so
activist  is the new term for idiot
why s that
haha then people will complain about how the neighborhood is  unsafe  due to the population that s there right now  let s face it
your comments are unnecessary  just read the document
telling people that their comments are unnecessary on an internet forum created as a venue for comments is pretty much a recipe for failure
cage is just a mindless group
you are completely wrong that columbia is doing any of these things to support the community  i challenge you to point me to examples of these things  i ll give you one  the employment center  no one has ever been employed out of there    i think when you say the community you mean us  columbia students  as james mcshane did in his letter in opposition to anyone that actually live 9 blocks up in the area where the expansion is happening  it s us vs them right  get out of the bubble man  you are probably a man
shills everywhere
you are probably a man   get out
1  gender essentialism  2  reductionist  3   internet telepathy  4   oh you re a maaayan
is that what i said
no  please say no more  you comments are vacuous  and perhaps a bit racist  the residents of grant and manhattanville housing have a right to live in peace
from many of your brazen remarks
manhattanville
what exactly are the  shares  that columbia is buying the manhattanville houses  i ca nt figure outnycha program you re talking about
greeted with a  columbia has declared war on harlem  sign  has it now  aside from signing the petition  and
yep  pretty muchdisgraceful   why do nt you drive your bmw back to the insular neighborhood from where you came
columbia was in this area before everyone else  it was farmland in morningside heights and manhattanville  everyone else moved to be near columbia  they infringed on columbia s land not the other way around  columbia brought the area jobs
correct  it s like saying the crime in cambridge is due to harvard moving in and building a building
we re talking about two different thingshistorically
that s not a very good analogy  everyone expects colleges and universities to expand over time
the guide aims to bring together all of the disparate information on columbias expansion into one easily accessible resource   seriously  the guide is a work of advocacy from one side of a dispute
well
barnard feminists loving this one
go here
i miss my parents
michael emerson ftw
she should sue them all for sexual harassment  one by one  all thousand of them

this was ridiculous  thought it was a joke at first
is nt it  i m still not sure  i like the fencing team a lot  they seem like great people  so i really hope this is a joke  it could be pretty funny
this is why advertisements use actors
as much as i love the columbia fencing team this entire video was a massive cringe  i really hope people do nt think of fencing this way
i d lose on purpose all the time  this place sucks
we re glad you re not playing on any columbia team
forced mandatory attendance to ivy league institutions strikes again

i think you re a massive prick and it reflects in your comment

great app  let s get it more used here
we are committed to redefining our online presence in a way that puts the needs of columbia university students first   because the best way to do so is through native advertising
hey  this is not native advertising  bwog never has and never will use native advertising
then do you know someone who worked on it  because this is a shameless advertisement if i ve ever seen one
stfu  they re reporting on something they personally think is cool and found a flyer for around campus  what s wrong with you
i think they spelled  we  wrong
i feel like this is something that will be so much more fun and useful
i totally agree with the above comments  let s all start using this app and maybe it ll get really big   i m definitely not being paid to say this  great article bwog
wait i do nt understand  your stalkers can see where you are and thus track you down  eek

but 2 black actors  2 servant characters  come on
sorry not sorry
it is a fair observationalso a fair observation is that reading a play meant to be seen performed does tend to leach the fun out of it  good point
it would have been okay
nice review
what
this was actually really funny and i kind of wan na do it  but i do nt know if you made the excellent sheep thing clear enough  bc its excellent sheep not ivy league sheep
pretty sure hana worthen is a barnard professor with a phd in theatre research  and by pretty sure i mean certain
they re actually spelling theatre correctly  theater is the physical building and theatre is the art form  fyi
it s  after goethe
this is an incredibly underresearched review  let me explain  the reviewer was wholly unaware of the people involved and incredible opportunity that this production gave to barnard and columbia s theatre students  no mention of the set
sociology colloquium series
but they do nt go herewait wut
why do nt we have a columbia way
you re basic
i honestly had nt heard of barnard until after i got into columbia  why do they get a street corner named after them
why did they take 116th st instead of 118th st  where their school actually is
barnard s campus is between 116th and 120th
but the main entrance is on 118th
117th
interesting schtick  i only have the attention span to follow one sport at a time
check out columbia beautiful athletic facilities as well as the new modern campbell sports center and boat house
great idea to combine games like this  if only professors did nt hand out exams over homecoming weekend  what an effing joke  every year with this st
we have sports at this school
the real question is whether there will be free beer as in years past  i have nt seen anything about that anywhere
4 free beers at every game
really
bwog
being you just published an article that is totally wrong    u think this is middle school
10 bucks says he wo nt even remember having this meeting an hour after it s over  definitely not more important than his calf workouts and the filet stuffed lobster tails he eats for lunch  the man is disgusting
i think you might be projecting a bit too much onto him
sounds delicious to me
bet prezbo divests from something
if i have nt met with you before to clear my questions can i still ask them
given the whole todo  in the apologychange post  about how this meeting was the chance for the public to shape what blog was going to be for the future
i wan na know
you should have come
it s not like this is a particularly busy time

so many gays are going to be all over this
takes shot
edgy
a new york times reporter spent an entire evening at the new yorker festival   is that really what you thought the huffpo summary of the times profile said
those are our numbers too   we have cuids  wut
those are not  our numbers  too  those are the numbers for cps  there are nt currently stickers with the info for furman
come on
gs students  same id
to address your concerns  there are current 5
thanks for the reply lauren
thank you sister lauren for your advocacy  we at nrt are proud of the accomplishments of our sisters in their advocacy against rape culture  as a board member of nrt i can assure you that this  while an important step  is just the beginning  we have to change the way people look at their interactions with each other  change the incentives to rape  increase the incentives to report abuse  empower women and people of color and the lgbt community  while i have been asked by my fellow sisters not to disclose too much of the soon to be released policy platform endorsed by the university
nothing hotter than a rape hotline  sign me up
are fucking tiny
what i m actually alarmed about is that bwog described bellvue as a few stops away on the subway
this year
stop trying to a real news source
no
we gon na die
just not from ebola
read the comment title  it s a joke
this means we should all avoid pre med students at all costs in case they work at the cumc right
he has not been at or near a columbia univeristy facility in months
i guess life postcolumbia is nt all bad
i need feminism because ebola
here s to thinning the herd  less people to mess up the curve
man
incidetally
i hope dr spencer recovers quickly  he exemplifies the best in the medical profession
it ll be easy to get caught up in the usual internet forum nonsense
it s absolutely time to panic  the crisis is coming  the cdc is lying about the extent to which ebola is penetrating the world around us
ebola is airborne     1
the media is blowing ebola of proportion  fine  honestly though
what about the subways though
it s been a little while  out of curiosity
how difficult is it to put a galley kithen in the lounge

this post gives me so many feels
will be buying an issue
the blue and white is actually free and will be distributed around campus in lerner
snaps
i am so jealous of you
you re the greatest
thank you
more hearts
this is so good  so so good  thank you for sharing   3  3
a good piece on bwog
last two sentences had me tearing up  this is an absolutely beautiful piece
you are beyond amazing
this is so great  3  3  3
but this actually so wellwritten  congratulations
mowill coffee is a thing
finally chance for something better to come in
maybe we ll get a good bar  hopefully  fingers crossed  that upstairs would be sweet
columbia
what is going in there
lots of places to get hammered around here  no place makes good
everyone knows red wine is worse for hangovers
we should get num pang to replace it  we need some south east asian sandwiches up in here
udon soup  you sure you re not mixing it up with m2m
uni café does have udon
if they were seized by the marshal s office
i m sorry  where does this imply that they were shut down by the health department
my comment s the opposite  they ve been shut down by health before  this is different
the article does nt say why uni was shut down one way or anotherdo u actually go to columbia  lolz
quick googling says that the city s marshals are not part of the nypdnysp system
i remember pinnacle
id theft not cool
please
noooooooo goddamnituni cafe had the cheapest breakfast in mohi   354  tax included  for a bagel sandwich
i liked the coffee  everybody was friendly  i will miss it
trouble paying the expensive rent probably
ahaha that guys sounds exactly like nev
girl in striped shirt
pretty funny
adil habib  3
adil why so goodlooking  do u like girls
yah and he s single
love this show
this is a really nice post and it s great to see all the columbia men who support this movement
yeah ill jump on the feminist train when it moves from this idea of women getting more rights then men to a goal of complete equality  otherwise its not gon na happen
really not here for recentering feminist spaces and discussions around dude s opinions
is nt it a little ironic that a single sex school is trying to teach a completely coed school about equity
this is gayyyyyy
using gay  to mean stupid  is neanderthallllll
hey
it seems a bit more  yeah
that was for  sheforshe
i reject hardline victim feminism  but fully embrace equality feminism  women  and men
i think you mean to say that you reject  radical  feminism  i m not sure what  victim  feminism is
what i meant by victim feminism is this  a group of zealots  and by zealots i do nt mean emma watson   are claiming to speak for all women
so happy about this and absolutely amazed at her campus barnard   honored to be a part of this community
will emmy wasson come visit
when all women need to enlist for the draft in order to vote
why would you rather women have to enlist for the draft than men not have to enlist for the draft  and in what way has the draft actually had any impact whatsoever on your life    presuming you re of typical college age and not an older gs student
because males can not get any financial aid
okay but you did nt really answer my questions  how is it a burden  the chances of the draft actually leading you to be forced into military service are essentially zero  and if you do view it as a burden
wait just realized you re not even a columbia student  no crown icon   not gon na debate something this pointless with some mra slacktivist who wastes time commenting on every article he finds that contains the word feminism
not this shit again
respect has to be mutual
oh and you re anonymous
the second picture tells it all   because i want all women to be treated as they deserve to be  chivalry is not dead   feminism is not about equality  it is nothing more than the latest instantiation of the gynocentrism that has always pervaded human society
you lost me at  vaginachasing white knights
and bring flowers
if only it was this easy
all bwog writes these days has to do about butler  24 hours in butler
butler  the musical
butler the vampire slayermo  butler
i disapprove  camping is an important part of butler library culture  you may not find a seat in butler when you want to
sceptical
like this
literally two sentences about the actual music again
when someone told me bwog was reviewing music

dont really care what the article says but jack  eliza are awesome
on point as usj
this is good
these emojis are solid gold  i say this as someone who teaches lit hum  nice work
yo
am i the only one who really could care less about any of this town hall bs
bwog board should all resign  this is an outrage worse then the cuban missile crisis
yup
i do nt know
i ca nt tell if this is a joke or not  but you do know that the cuban missile crisis was that missiles were going to go from cuba to the us right
no threat of us invasion of cuba at all during this period
bwog should simply be shut down and its staff subject to the dean s discipline
the apology for bwog s poor journalism in assuming the full legitimacy of a random  tip  and jumping to a number of false conclusions
i do nt see any problem  how can you be a  student activist  and want to hide your identity  who cares who was on the document
students associated with queer and trans groups that may not be out to their families  not everyone on the doc spokepublicly identified themselves and there s legit reasons to want to protect your privacy
bwog does it again
way to give in
also what exactly are you apologizing for  and to whom  the columbia communities
so basically you were so eager to get the jump on a juicy story you could nt even check which names were on the public record  and where s the apology for running a smear campaign against jo and ss
can someone explain to me why they were at risk of suspension
also why it matters whether their names were a matter of public record  other than the argument that it might put students in danger
my understanding is they could have been suspended or gone through some sort of disciplinary process if they had been thought to have violated usenate confidentiality rules
if they violated senate confidentiality rules
as our readership grew
bwog needs to go on hiatus
fucking this  return in a month
it is ridiculous to expect people to believe that the same people can do things differently  you are still not apologizing for putting the effort of students as well as their ability to even be in this school at risk
bwog
this
i dont have time to crash your honeycomb hideout for a meeting
who thinks bwog should nt ask you what it should be
do nt do these things
k
i actually like it when bwog smacks down the activists  but then again
spec coverage of this was much
spec sucks
fuck you bwog i hate you
most blogs that post things about columbia are all fakes and untruths  this is nothing new  that emma story got out of han
bwog sucks  i like the pain
doubling down on  redact
bwog is a joke and always will be  i hope none of the affiliated people hope to ever work in journalism or if they do i hope they do nt mention this awful website anywhere on their job applications  it s existence embarrasses me as a cu student
its
if these student leaders broke the rules
yes  it should be ironic that the activists are using more oppressive strategies of press and image control than the administration
yes  as mark twain once said
you ca nt be  a preeminent independent source of student news and information   preeminent means surpassing all others  what you mean to say is that you are  the preeminent   i do nt know what s worse
this type of bullshit is precisely the reason why i wrote two articles for your publication before jumping ship  you re not journalists  you re wannabe gawker writers with overinflated egoes
you do realize that the cuban missile crisis would have led to the complete destruction of cuba if the missiles had actually been fired  but please
meeting s tonight  in case you want to swing by and provide feedback
we deeply regret the events of the past few days
how has no one commented on this yet
is hard to masturbate to
how does this garbage get published  and btw
seriously  this is the quality of writing on bwog these days
this is above bwog s average  fwiw  actual things happened and were reported upon
this was nt a fashion show for the sake of a fashion show
leave it to bwog
this review was pretty audacious
would have been nice to hear what the director s thoughts were on the show  why did nt they reach out to someone to interview
i really enjoyed the show  raffle was a bit long though  good cause
since when is raising some serious money for survivors of domestic violence considered  sorority shenanigans   a coverage bwog
since when does mcd have mozz sticks and how are they
good  the marinara sauce that it comes with is much better than i would have assumed
about said mozz sticks
yes  glad to hear a sensible decision was made
once again
you absolutely are not part of my group and you do not speak for me
how can you be so sure they are nt part of your group  or that they do nt speak for any other activist
because i know everyone in nrt and we know how much support sejal has given us  or attempted to give us  there s been some weird racism in the group i m not going to go into now   we know who our real enemies are  they are not sejal or jared  and if you think they are
activists showing up to a town hall  brilliant
most people involved with actvism know full well about ss s desire to be quoted and seen up front as the chief activist
that s zoe ridolfi starr s role  she s much more ready to thrust herself into the limelight than sejal
lol
consistently and forever grateful to the time and energy these two put into showing up to meetings
wait  so did neither spec nor bwog actually just ask jared or sejal whether the allegations were true  really  no
so their friends found them not guilty
i think i vomitted in my mouth a little
do nt know if i d do it myself

library activitiesbwog
consistent newsfollowup question  who qualifies as a  student leader  for purposes of zipcar registration  that is unethical
why is that unethical  he s the zipcar campus rep for columbia  nothing to do with his position on ccsc  people who are campus reps for red bull  dig inn use their friendpeople they know
1 this recap is the only reason i still read bwog2  why wait until april 1 to reveal the headliner who ll perform april 4  so we ca nt invite our friends from other schools  3  no more columbia music festival is okay means one less concert during the week  think hoodie allen from 2013   that needs to be made up for in free stufffood during college days
where does it say headliners will be announced april 1st     also
hey bwog  thanks for covering the presentation i gave yesterday  i wanted to make a distinction between what campus life is in the process planning for college days and the great work of bacchanal since the difference may not be clear in the articlewe are tentatively planning for the week leading up to bacchanal for college days because of it s timing  bacchanal is a day that all undergraduate students look forward to regardless of school  it s not officially a part of college days  as of now
how prominent
student leaders discount
so basically they gave themselves a discount on your backs  do nt pay into this nonsense
on whose backs  students are nt paying for this zipcar thing  do nt be ridiculous
a good source on why the continuing bruce jenner is trans rumors are bunk and very gross
if you were on facebook this is when i d decide to unfriend you
are you enjoying welcome to night vale
so suppose we were to hunt down this mystery pterodactyl  and suppose we were to cook and serve it
and the fact that they did this is a problem because  while it is a little bit methodical
be more of an obv shill
if you were at the town hall
despite being an unequivocal supporter of all of the groups who were responsible for most of the comments
and so the students organized to
so a student risked suspension to help protect free speech on campus
this was highly effective and a perfect demonstration of free speech and organizing  so now bwog is up is hung then for exercising their free speech  wow
wikileaks took great care to analyze and purge documents of names of agents of empire and informants
where does it even say that the committee member wrote the questions  i see no proof of that here
they got the google doc
according to a tip we received earlier today
also  if it was a google doc
bwog has consistently shown a pattern of bias against protester  from outing the student who felt like her life was in danger based on a photograph of her remaining online  whose name they ve now published
this is a good post  this is what bwog should be doing  writing the story behind the story  not the spec news writeup or rehashing mass emails  saying what actually drives these townhalls
addendum  i bet emails and texts are going around saying
this is pretty clearly the collective effort of a lot of campus organizers not the work of any one student  tone it down
the breadth of the doc implies that it was clearly crowdsourced  even if it were nt
also
claire friedman was the one that posted this
putting a document into wordpress is different from being the one controlling what the content is
goodman was out of town all day yesterday without cell phone access  why do you think this was posted yesterday
because she told them to
bwog wtf why do you keep deleting comments
how dare student senators work with students they are supposed to be representing      if the administration tries to fuck singh and odessky over
and what exactly are you going to do if the university decides to enforce the rules  throw a tantrum on low steps  as if the rest of us will bother to listen
wait this is actually a problem   most likely to sway swing votes
no one packed the room genius
pack the room  is verbatim in there
many students
this is harassment  solidarity with all those whose names appeared
so basically
additionally
you do understand that the students who asked questions did so at a public town hall
it s a pretty serious concern for students  there s no excuse to publish their names in this context
activists wrote a lot of those questions  s and j are in trouble foe breaking senate confidentiality rules  they re in trouble because they did nt buy the party line about how this was just to  update  the rules
this is really not a particularly big deal  questions are planted in some form at forums at basically every institution  they re just usually planted verbally and not in writing  the real issue here is just an aberrative lapse in judgment regarding the organizing mechanism
bwog is one of the most pathetic news publications that unfortunately lacks integrity
1 it s not bwog s job to support your political views  it s bwog s job to report campus news  2 how does putting activists  in danger   when they were breaking rules because the majority of students did nt care about the rules to make everything go in their favor since the  random turnout  was only 20  threaten minorities  care to explain that one  you seem to believe that your voice is the minority voice  well
rabble rabble zionist conspiracy rabble rabble rabble
now that the names are down
i do nt understand  each person that asked a question had to state their name and affiliation for the public record  so that a transcript of the event could be distributed following the event  bwog is bad for posting their names but columbia is nt
they consented to having their names tied with what they said publicly  this is a private document
i agree that publishing the names of people is problematic
thank you
it sounds like you re being quite selective about what you think should be transparent
it kinda seems like the type of journalism that is trying to make something out of nothing  also could use a tl  dr version
what has been compromised in this whole affair is not the legitimacy of the review committee
the job of a journalist is to report facts
how do you select which facts to report  what motivations inform these decisions
you do nt pick which facts to report  you report all of them and let the readers draw their own conclusions  no leftist bias must be tolerated in journalism  if i wanted your opinion
death to hipsters
when you redact things
speaking as someone who has very recently started to actually take an interest in campus politics and the groups and students who engage in campus politics  who
truly though  the language even sounds like her
off
same as anonamoose  you prob not just edit this shit in direct response to the comments without noting that errors and bad unclear writing were made before  smdh bwog
hey bwog could you put down the editing pen for one second so that each reader who arrives is nt reading an entirely different fucking article than the last person  absolutely pathetic
this is horrible reporting
as a student that actually support most of the opinions of the activists and less harsh sentencing for protestors
i found the leak
who
if you think i leaked it
yes yes yes100
completely agreed  thanks for saying thispast senators have been shit on because they work too closely with the administration and do nt have students  interests in mind
bwog
claire friedman from bwog and samantha cooney from spec are really thorough journalists  if only they could shift their focus from exposing a student senator for being on a google doc with students they are supposed to represent to something slightly more substantive  like administrators making senators sign a gag order against talking to studentswtf bwog spec  i hope you know that you have significantly damaged student s last chance to save political activityfree speech on campus  once that s gone you will have nothing to write about and that will be the end of your shitty campus media roles
spec never printed the google doc in full
if you have nt realized
how do you select which facts to report  what motivations inform these decisions
wait a minute  campus organizers  organized   what is this madness   obviously the people with the potential to be negatively impacted by a change in policy were the people to show up and push for a different policy  the fact that it was a collaborated effort says  what exactly  that our different campus activist groups can come together to work on work that affects them all  i m sorry
i speak by authority for the whole universityfor my colleagues of the trustees and for my colleagues of the facultieswhen i say
there is so much of hearsay
yay fabi  3 gc is da besttt
as an alumna taking the course i can say it is fantastic
tim schenk should be spelled shenk  he s also the best ta i ve had at columbia
got it
we re doing nlp with michael collins using coursera with the inverted classroom model and it s the best  you get to actually talk with your professor and have all the lectures and resources online  also

this is definitely not an accepted emoticon
my anaconda do nt want none unless you got buns hun
love this
these are fantastic  i demand more
i always assumed the big cases of encyclopedias in the ref room were remnants of an era where they were actually used heavilybut looks like there were actually way more tables in their place back in the daywe should change it back
this is very creative  the photos are fantastic
i really like these too  more
agreed
does anyone know what years the older photos are from
best post of the semester

great job guys
why is this being published 10 months later
what the fuck
in light of tomorrows town hall on protest rules
whoops meant to reply to  question
other than the requests to take down content on private facebook pages
k james mcshane
regardless of who you are
is this incessant drive to be an apologist a fundamental feature of columbia
administrative shill detected
anyone who expects a modicum of privacy in today s day and age is either naive or a fool  one minor example  cumail  googlemailremember  if you re not paying for something
true
email was intended to by a p2p service  and it still basically isthe solution is to buy your own domain and use open source software to run your own email server
public safety is a real mess  sounds like there s a huge disconnect between the uniforms who patrol the campus and the suits who dictate policy  why does nt columbia have cops to keep the campus secure
does anyone else feel hopelessly damaged sometimes
eeah    everyone allied against homophobia
these flyers are incredibly guilttrippy
this is honestly hilarious
what douche bag reports their own cava to bwog
carabet
omg atheist boys are the cutest
boys who believe in determinism have way sweeter assesreally
is if one of these guys will fuck the religion out of me
disrespectful
i find no point in having a group that wants to discuss why god does not exist  why are you so fixed or rather so passionate about talking about things that do not exist  is it because they do and the group is rather to prove to oneself that something that does exist does not  i understand religious groups trying to strengthen faith but a group focused on their belief that nothing exist is a group on nothingness   what discussion is there  and do you honestly believe religious communities would want to have a  dialogue  with you  not really
you should try reading the interview
this group is pointless why spend so much time trying to talk about something you dont believe it
i think you missed the point of lithum and cc
in defending sam harris
this comment is literally incoherent  what
criticisms of ideas are not racism  skin color does not tell you anything about how someone behaves  ideas about what is true and what is good do affect behavior  to judge someone on hisher skin color or ethnic background is prejudice  to criticize a set of beliefs is not  islam
to assume the authority to discuss a religion of a 16 billion people
thank you  that needed to be said  so long as this club does nt become a hotbed of religious intolerance
with all due respect
but
one of my uah roommates took a cross pen that i bought as a memento from my community college years  it has the college s seal in bronze on the clip  i m still a bit upset about it
really
the pregnant roommate thing actually happened to me and let me tell you it was fucking horrible
do tell  sounds interesting
she did nt flush her used toilet paper
in some places in the worldusa
confronts you when you go out without himher one weekend and then proceeds to invite himherself to anything youre doing with your other friends  preach
does he like me  are we just hooking up  i m so confused  also i m wayyyyy too busy for this shit
this is getting out of control
a 90 minute monologue  you could nt pay me a million bucks to go there
literally the best description of this event  so spot on
what an impartial comment
the good news is that not all columbia students are as narrowminded and plebeian as mr cooper  i am happy to suggest community colleges to which he might transfer  for the record
nicholas christieblick  valiant effort
that was left by him
any student interested in a conversation rather than sounding off anonymously is welcome to come to office hours friday from 1000 am to noon  you may be surprised
for a onemanshow
this seems like a suspicious town to be trying to shut down protest on campus
it s not that it s columbia trying to suddenly shut it down  in contrast
clarification  rittenberg is sympathetic because he protested in 1968
tl  dr
hear
why are you reading bwog if you do nt care about the shit that s happening on campus
i care about columbia
what year did you graduate
cause god forbid bwog posts about something that actually affects our lives at columbia  do nt get me wrong
what s your point  froscanity and ngate affect my life way morethis shit does nt
like literally cu dems could have been expelled for putting flags in the lawn on 911  wtf  cause that would count as minor property damage
cucr puts up the flags
good to know  i would nt want them expelled for that either tbh
i believe the complaint against the minutemen protestors was referred to rittenberg
suit 2 obviously does nt understand the implication of the term sunk cost
there s a sunk cost phallusy joke in here somewhere
he meant opportunity cost

the concert made me feel such a sense of togetherness with the southasian community here at columbia  it felt like eating homecooked food together on the dining table or like lighting a firecracker with my family on diwali  penn masala made me feel in sync with everybody here  penn masala made me feel at home   as a chinese student continents away from home and who misses her mom more than anything else
zamana did such a good job
hate the people who did nt let me in

meeting with admin and eating dino bbq on our student life fees
was getting admins to meet with nonccsc students really 6th on that list of 7 items
the list is in no particular order
i do nt want to go to school  i just want to break the rules of university conduct
thanks for sharing these events
why did you include  innocent
maybe because she later recanted  bizarrely    my dad never did any of those things
lol if you think columbia would be nice enough to give its homeless students blankets

our admins are out of touch
this could have been a new employee who is still learning the basics  or maybe bwog s mistaken
should nt columbia students know  then  from  than
rape culture
was this accidentally published  it s riddled with typos
this is bwog  the name itself is a typo
i think that should be bwog s tagline
this is just terrible
this garden party was a joke   5 for 3 plates of carrots
flex money aka laundry money is monopoly money  does nt exist
i do not use flex accounts since i am a grad student but keep up that mindset
my parents are paying for this
bow tie  tie ftw
literally this interview presents two incredibly self absorbed and self indulgent people  ear pieces  for a reslife event on the lawns with 10 people  and one of the causes the money goes to is  funding the event  thats a cause  resume builders
yes that is a party  an 840 class on a friday morning with class size of 3 has more people than this   dying
i saw this kid walking around brazenly with a tie and bowtie  takes balls
the garden party was whatever it was
the least such a terrible party can do is give us a hilarious article
by tracking your comments we can see you obviously have a very personal connection to making this eventarticle suck less by commenting multiple times to feign interest
i was there at the party and this article makes it out to be way worse that what it was  and anyway
a post bwog

may i offer  blurrydogtumblrcom
best bwog post of the semester

there are no hot gays at columbia

the ceilings leak from students plugging toilets from the floor above  if people were a little bit more careful
unlike other locations
my bathroom ceiling fell down and we had to have emergency maintence
im pretty sure that having an inaccessible stairwell constitutes a city  if not statefederal  fire code violation
that depends on how many other stairs are available  if there are more than enough
not necessarily true
this  is horrible
weekend at bernie s was so good
this is so gay
this nickname sucks
now we ca nt play  movin  like bernie  ironically and do the bernie dance

hey
also because i m a senior this is my             boschwan song

all of these were my  boschwasted  ideasbut thx for taking the hate bub
hey brit you were in my class last year and i thought you were hot  are you single and looking to mingle
depends  what do you think of the name boschwo
the problem is nt whether or not it makes sense  the problem is that it s a fucking garbage nickname shoehorned in when much better alternatives were already presented
what
look
k
you re really gon na call  haters gon na hate  on a stupid nickname contest  wow  they say you can tell someone by the quality of their enemies  you either set the gain way too low
boschwanda
peaches offers a solid defence  i m still not saying this
to be honest

where do you go
i agree
what about beersch  one syllable
schwanz

oh
when dean rinere asked if anyone wanted to be a professor
exhibit a why these writeups are the best thing bwog does
so class of 2016 council is doing nothing
or bwog just does a shitty job at reporting
class apparel is in the works as are a few other events this semester and a spring formal
the maximum time for medical has been increased from one academic year to two     that ca nt be true  the maximum time allotted for medical leave has always been two years
you are correct  there s nothing new about medical leaves lasting for up to two years  this is how it has been for quite some time  it s not a change  what s new is that you can potentially return from a medical leave after just one semester away  in the earlier policy
this is disrespectful to all the jewish people fasting today on yom kippur  if anyone goes

does bwog manage to make two typos in the first two sentences of an article
an atrociously written article
young jean lee in many ways represents writing at its oldest      honestly bwog should take this down

not gon na mention his ice bucket publicity stunt
yeah
classic columbia politics  all you need to do is take a 20 sec video pouring ice water on your head and voila you re president
we ca nt hate on the kid for actually campaigning  i am not saying that his publicity stunts were nt cliché but he at least did it right
haha to be bluntly honest
implying that other student council races are nt popularity contests
kid s a scumbag for sure
oh good
i think it is somewhere between fallacious and antisemitic to assume he is a zionist based on your rationale  however
come on  we have tons of students at columbia who went to yeshiva
so pretentious  and not particularly well written either   great choice
pretentious  yespoor writing  yesaccurate statement  yes
never met the kid  but people calling him scum  it s fucking ccsc
he is a brilliant guy  fits the job and therefore he won
i want to mushroom stamp his fart box
so excited    ezra s gon na do a great job
yeeee ezra  you re the man  ignore the haters  gon na do a great job
tracked  too obvious

privilege
thank you for not being whiny about this
transphobic title  i am ashamed
you re not the kind of reader bwog wants
barnard itself is transphobic
it s a fact that
what is cis though
there are many more barnard students that eat in john jay or jj place than the other way around
do you have data on this  does it account for all the jewish students that flood hewwitt for the apparently excellent kosher kitchen
the kosher kitchen is terrible and we pay directly to barnard  plus it s more money   trust me
think of it this way  more vajayjays in john jay and ferris
anybody remember me

ivy council is fucking stupid
this series started out as funny but now it s just devolved into everyone trying to out humblebrag each other
well they are doing a shitty job  this stuff is so boring
women smile at female on male domestic violence
bwog being caring and considerate and objectively informative with their articles  what in the hell is going on
when is dodge least crowded
sundays
why was the injured person taken to harlem hospital instead of stlukes which is literally down the block
just hazarding a guess
it s also possible that the st luke s er was full or experiencing some other type of problem
is this a cu building  do we know if the injured person is a cu affiliate
it s a residential apartment building that s not affiliated with columbia whatsoever
that s good to know  but some tenants may be cu faculty
it is 404 riverside drive
listen to wbar  it s great
wow  i like this  less rape paranoia and hysteria and more music and fun

i love mama pies and i eat a lot of pies so i know high pie quality when i taste it and boys
how many pies is a lot of pies
mama pies is a wonderful thing  i have a  ratatouille  moment every time i bite into one of those mini scrumptious things  sometimes when guys ask for my number i give them mama pies number so at least they re let down with a delicious pie  ca nt wait for the exciting pies to come
i had one of these pies and i came
despite what you have been told
just what
had one of these pies last friday and have dreamt about it every night since

it is cool that the world s leaders all come to campus to give talks
so
yes there was a question about chinajapan relations  someone asked about the islands dispute
you seriously expected unscreened question from random attendees  whatever gave you that impression  you re nuts if you think that would ever happen

cusfs was founded in the spring of 1976 the founders soon learned that there had been a number of previous similar clubs in columbia s history that had fallen apart after their original members graduated  one of the ways the founders of cusfs thought to sustain the club was by establishing a librarynearly a decade later

how is this  off  campus at all  with the exception of cg and carlton arms
i lived on 110th and bway
wow  six whole city blocks  you poor thing
your apartment was 4 blocks from the edge of the main campus  it takes longer to walk from pupin to butler than it does to walk from your apartment to butler  it s a longer distance  120th to 114th instead of 110th to 114th
wow this article is terrible
living off campus is generally not fun  it is very isolating
i live in ruggles  you do nt have to live off campus to do all that stuff
this is basically the nail in the coffin for no red tape et al  columbia s legal experts  you know
god
nail in the coffin  more like they ve served their purpose  they ve been requesting this data for so long  this data is very encouraging to me as a woman on campus  i
columbia used to release the number of reported  forcible sexual assaults  every year along with the other ivies  the number was always  20 or so
you feel unsafe here   good luck with the rest of your life  this probably the safest most supportive place you will ever be in for the rest of your life
despite what you have been told
the student  activists  have only made the situation worse
the betacide is reaching its peak now  betas have always been punished for the behavior of alphas
not to mention that so many of the accusations of sexual assault have been a complete bogus
this was poorly written it made my head hurt
try less  also
i m covering my ears like a kid  when your words mean nothing i go bah bah bah
no one is reporting on the fact that his daughter went to columbia  hannah deresiewicz
fact checking  he has no kidshis niece went here and his other niece goes here
he is a famous multi millionaire because of his three columbia degrees  and his kids went here too  easy for him to say
he is neither famous
so basically
so people accused of sexual assault should automatically be kicked off
jesus
that s not all what it said  if i just say you hit me
rape is bad
despite what you have been told
here s a recent case at occidental in which consensual sex gets a guy expelled because the girl regretted it after  this is the path columbia s going along   in the early morning of sept 8
let s also not forget that by this standard
let a  sober person has sex with drunk person b  rape has occureda   batherefore
this is nt my standard of  consent
when a stone cold sober person say s no
here s the logic  women sometimes want sex so men should always get consentmen always want sex so consent should be treated as a givensee how assigning stereotypes to entire genders makes everything simpler
re   what s wrong with you  that s not actually how the story goes  emma concedes that she had prior relations with the guy and initiated the sex in her room
emma could not have been the rapist because she was the victim of rape  what sort of twisted logical masturbation are you engaging in  to go a bit further with this analogy people who want to accuse emma of raping her rapist are engaging in logical masturbation
i m gon na need to see some receipts
you guys are awful and pretty stupid  you cant consent if you re drunk  if you do nt remember the incident you were drunk  you therefore couldnt consent  anything anyone did to you was rape  this is nt that hard to understand
what if both parties can not remember because they were both blackout drunk  is it double rape or can we consider that not sexual assault
also
the more i learn about es
like omg  when will these rapists like stop raping people  i was like walking to 1020 last night and this guy asked me for the time  it was obvious he was trying to rape me so i said  get away from me rapist    then he like looked at me all creepily and said  did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed    and that freaked me out so much because it was obvious he was gon na roofie me and take me to his bed  so i go  i m not gon na let you rape me you bastard   i called public safety and they tasered him  omg thank you columbia thank you for keeping the rapists away i cried all night over this traumatic experience but then i went to rape crisis center and all of a sudden i felt okay again because they gave me a book called  yes means yes  and it was like sooo good
troll much
sherlock
emma is on the cover of ny mag  well done    i applaud her  this girl got her fifteen minutes of fame by exploiting the issue of rape  emma s misguided need for attention is now a red herring that distracts from helping those who are victims of rape  emma is  raping  the attention all for herself  does anyone else see the irony in that   she has committed to carrying around a twinsize dorm mattress everywhere she goes on campus     somebody did nt get enough attention from their parents growing up
before everyone continues to make sweeping generalizations about sex and gender and college and the student body of this university in particular
bwog comments make me feel like dying  you are all trolls  all of yer
as a senior board member of no red tape i want to clear up some misconceptions  we are not just trying to get some guy kicked out of school  that is not even close to our mission  in fact the individual is not the problem
this comment seriously confuses me  like i was with you for the first couple sentences and then it got bizarre
thank you for being a survivor and for showing others that we do nt just disappear  but i am confused as to why you have singled out my comment for disparaging remarks  i just believe that the rape that you and i have experienced did nt have to occur  that individuals only act according to what society dictates is acceptable behavior and that men have been programmed to believe that rape is acceptable  i believe that we can stop them from raping others through progressive reeducation and that begins with behaviorist exercises in which they experience the same verbal and physical abuse women experience everyday  it is the only program that has proven to reduce incidents of rape by 100   in addition to that i believe that we need to fix this broken administrative hearing system  if a woman is brave enough to make a complaint she should be believed  anything besides a presumption of guilt is to say that women are liars and rape does nt exist  maybe i was inarticulate the first time i tried to express these views and you thought i was advocating for something else  if that was the case i hope you understand the sensible suggestions of no red tape and that you support them as the policy is implemented campuswide
please stop making fun of barnard already  we had a few laughs
i honestly do nt know how you can live in the same planet and think that men believe
i do appreciate the fact that you re trying to be neutral here  it may be a bit too late for that
of course no red tape supports survivors and of course no red tape is in favor of the collective carry and of course no red tape strongly supports bringing awareness to the general community about threats to women including the criminal who victimized emma  what do nt you get about that  all i m saying
no red tape does nt have a board and it does nt want any of the things the first poster asked for  yall are getting trolled
your mom does nt have a board
sister it appears that you are a novice in no red tape  i strongly encourage you to reach out to your elder sister who can help dispel your misconceptions about what no red tape stands for and for the hierarchical relationship  indeed we have a board and it consists of sisters who have been there from the beginning many of which are now graduates of the university  i take it that you have not attended any of the board meetings because you are not a member
of course
manboy jake i do nt care for your tone  you can disagree with our platform because you believe that rape culture can be better addressed by other means
bc 16are you really serious or just trolling  you say that  as long as we keep the republicans  sic  out of office we can end rape   you do realize that there are over 180 countries on this earth where the republican party does nt hold any elected office
i should make clear that i completely sympathize with and do not wish to diminish your experiences
how is putting your thing in someones ass even illegal the anus is not a sexual organ  its literally like giving someone a high five  what will they think of next  putting your finger in someone s ear is rape
shut up
these data prove that on this campus at least
the majority of assaults are not reportedgod
25  of the female student body is 400 students  do you seriously believe that 9275  of the women who were assaulted did not report it to anybody
what kind of strange moon math is this  where did i say that 100  of all women are assaulted
the two definitions of rape she uses are state based and the narrower fbibased
unreported  so what can you do about that  still call it  rape culture  and then guess how many cases are underreported  or even worse
i agree with you that say campus is less safe than a war zone is an incredible stretchbut it is incorrect to assume that only 145  of women at columbia have experienced sexual assault  this is data about reported rates of a severely underreported crime  especially at the university level
and for the record
you re the voice of reason  right on  thank you
get your orders of magnitude right

if you wan na stroke the dolphin

you ve clearly never taken adderall
so girls complain when we do nt rape them and instead fulfill our urges in a positive manner  when will the feminists ever be happy  i ve seen girls doodling the clam in the but before
why does everything have to be about rape and feminists  masturbation is great
why should the government tell me what to do with my body
why should the government tell me what to do with my body
this is nt about the government  it s just we d rather not see that in the library
do nt call complainants survivors until it has been determined that an actual assault occurred  it unfairly biases processes and is an apriori determination of guilt  also
over this past year
this may be nit picky but also not every survivor of trauma who goes to cps choses to undergo the adjudication process  or is even able to  so to conflate the terms complainants  and survivors  is reductive  tl  dr
you mispelled dickwad
some students come to columbia without knowing they have learning disabilities  legitimately do nt understand how you can not realize something like this that seems so critical to even getting you here
hey anon  i m someone with a learning disability
anyway
hmmm  i guess i did nt realize stuff like that happened past high school  thanks for helping clear up my misconceptions   hopefully this  tracks  from above
lets all sing along   you ca nt hurry loveno
when i went to rutgers we did nt have this rape problem  hell if a woman said no lets just say we did nt resolve it by penetrating them  we took care of it in a different way  i had an encounter like that once in an elevator

no

hey bwog
a period
even i could tell it was a period
the part in quotes was copied and pasted directly from the article when it was originally posted  obviously
my gosh i feel like a total geek for pointing this out
seriously  why are we objectifying women by saying that they are the only ones who eat brownies  i m a woman and i do nt like brownies  why could nt the article say  2 guys 1 snack  when ca nt we women stop being bitches to one another

these are all smart barnard chicks talking  i m so glad they re part of our community to enlighten us and enrich intellectually
can we stop talking about barnard women as if they re all pretty humanities majors with edgy interests  there are feminist cc girls who love margaret atwood

and i m a creative writing major who s concentrating in compsci  what s your point  am i dumb and useless when i m in a class for my major
there is no point

margaret atwood is very much canadian

either seriously misinformed or an idiot if you think personal consumption is the root of the problem  jesus christ
what do you think the root of the problem is
those people could probably be doing more to reduce their footprint
if i learned anything at columbia
my point is this is a movement about fixing systemic and political problems  personal choices are nt made in a vacuum  my options as a consumer are defined by my city and country

after reading this brief summary of events i found burton to be a more pro general student body candidate  he seems to want to help everyone with the lowering of sandwich prices and hopefully drive prices down throughout morningside with coordinated student boycotts  klimentov on the other hand is going for a more pro financial aid students approach which i think is nice
burton  u r cute  wan na go on a date
sure thing babe  just do nt expect me to spend more than ten dollars  we have to exercise our power as consumers to affect positive change

why did bwog take down the rakhi agarwal story
because it s complicated and they were asked to take it down
oh so complications and being  asked to take it down  were enough this time  how come the editorial board did nt extend the same courtesy to the palestinian rights protester who feared for hisher life  i m glad bwog atleast did the right thing this time
the girl has been found
yeah fuck free speech and the right to protest
as a quasijournalistic enterprise
i m jealous of this

this post is not entirely accuratebarnard students were not allowed into jj s place at all until september 2012
why do you deserve special treatment  columbia students ca nt swipe into late night dining either
my point is not that barnard students should have access to jj s place for late night dining and columbia should not have access to hewitt for late night dining  that has been standard for a number of years  my point is that barnard dining should not dramatically change its policies on barnard students  who are all affected because barnard students all have to buy meal plans   this has been happening since nsop of this year  barnard students were not allowed to swipe into john jay during a portion of nsop but then were suddenly allowed to at certain points without notice
are you kidding me    i live for that pizza and thursday guacamole  and the cookies oh the cookies
both barnard and this post are jokes  find your own school and leave ours alone please   ourblue  golions
your dick s a joke
i agree in principle with anon
how can you say that an institution that has been providing an elite education for women for the past 125 years a joke  learn some respect
elite
if there were an elite institution that provided education for only men for 125 years
there was  it s called columbia college
this is a hate crime against my relationship with jj s mozzarella sticks
barnard students go to barnard
cc and seas students take barnard classes too  it goes both ways  it s not like i love how some classes at my small liberal arts school ends up with 200 students because columbia students decide barnard classes are better which they tend to be
or easier  just saying
just easier
there are other hours in the day that barnard students can swipe in jj s
not anymore  i tried today and they said barnard students can not swipe into jj s anymore
saw some barnard students denied on my way in  please let them back it s a sausage fest now
omg this is too real  please help this boy out and let us in     you ca nt just have sausage you ll go into cardiac arrest
can someone from columbia please why the majority of you are so opposed to barnard students eating at columbia dining halls  because if you re worried we ll eat all your food
because we got into an top 4 ivy league school and you got into a maybe top 50 school so why the hell should we treat you as our equals  if you wanted to enjoy columbia s facilities fully then you should have come to columbia  i do nt go down to nyu and demand to use their dinning halls because why should i feel so entitled that no one can stop me from eating where i want  i feel the same way about barnard demanding to use our dinning halls  you choose to go to your small school so stop trying to become part of our school
hey top ivy 4 classmate  how about keeping quiet when you feel like being an asshole  if you re going to act as if you re smarter and at a better level
you should treat us as equals because we re human beings  unless admittance to columbia gives you some sort of godly soul
ha top4ivy commenter  pretty confident that you re a fugly cc girl who s pissed that barnard chicks get all the guys at mel s
are you a 1armed competitive ping ponger from bumfuck nowhere  you must be cause theres no way you would ve gotten into a  top 4 ivy league school  being such an ignorant fuck otherwise  xoxo
lol so you go to one of the top 4 ivy schools and you ca nt even spell  dining   maybe learn to spell before you start hating on another college that is a part of your university  i mean
you are an affiliate   not part of the school  those gates are old and from when barnard was part of columbiafirst
the first few weeks of classes this year

seas girls can still swipe into jj s   barnard girls are definitely not smart and they look like dogs
know what  bitches get stuff done  tina fey
to have the best community
barnard is just as much columbia as is seas and gs  so why should it be any different
no  ccseas are one entity  barnard and gs
then tell me why each school has individual graduation ceremonies and one unified convocation for the entire university   the key word being university   the fact is
they are separate institutions that are closely affiliated
then why am i in cc and my roommate is in seas    are ccseas really that separate
seas actually does not apply separately from cc
barnard is not columbia  period
read the gate motherfucker
the columbia gates or the barnard one  much like the respective websites
i propose a petition  how are we supposed to believe we are one school if we can not even eat at all the dinning halls
if barnard became 100  independent
but same if gs became 100  independent
except that seas is a columbia school
that s not true though  when i submitted my application
i found the freshman  d
firstyear  do you even go here
wtf  yall are always waiting for any chance to hate on barnard  get over yourselves  you wo nt be in college forever  you re gon na have to go into the real world
i am hoping this just a financial issue that needs to be resolved  the more dining options open to the students on campus
this a stupid issue and should be fixed everyone should be allowed in jj s  but it reflects how fucked up the whole barnard columbia relationship is  seriously no one is happy about how confusing it is  barnard students or columbia students
starting to worry when comments on bwog are worse than comments on youtube  yikes
of this bullshit  every fecking year the firstyears bitch about things like this
more curly fries for columbia students then
it s okay
seriously i gained 30 pounds fresh year primarily cause of cravings to eat this shit
i like going to columbia even if others do nt find it fun  barnard girls are easy to get with so i think that it is good that it is close by  i do nt mind what they call themselves because i am comfortable with who i am  a rich
wow
it s food  we all like to eat  this has nothing to do with intelligence or what school we got into  it s sad this always happens even with silly things like swipe access to jjs  cmon people
this person is a monster
barnard is not columbia college
it would nt be special treatment  cc students do nt have access to late night hewitt hours
congratulations
that is a sexist comment against males  why is it accepted to berate and abuse males
this is the reporting i love bwog for
bwog is back
vid pls
amen
have nt seen shit this good for 5 years
more of this please  3
this is why i love bwog  keep it up

dumb
bwog needs all the help it can get
ding dong the witch is dead
wonder how much money they wasted on this shit
new ninja was working perfectly fine
the new system was not a bad idea
i guess you could say the new ninja disappeared in a puff of smoke
groan
what was wrong with the new system  i personally found it really convenient to be able to send a document to the cloud and and go to any printer i wanted to print from on campus
you kinda fucked up your definitions there
does this mean we will get the write up of the lewisohn looter now
maud and sarah faith have done such a great job as editors in chief  sad to see them go
does this mean fewer shitty wannabeactivist articlesmattress girl stories  please say yes  i miss the old cheeky yet informative bwog
go punch yourself in the face
comments and replies like this are what i miss about bwog  bringbacktheoldbwog
bring back the sass of svokos
fuck svokos  she was just as bad
no
because you re the cancer that is killing bwog
dae think bwog was better last year  upvotes pls
what about alex

alexander alexander alexander
yea lol bwog why are you covering up your other resignation
yeah alexander we ll miss you
bwogger julia  from last year s vshow was actually just based off of julia goodman  or just her squirrel sweater  or maybe her bangs
is there anyone left in bwog
3 you two always
things wont be the same
thank jesus maybe bwog will get a bit better now  fuck those 2
what about alex
this is just like ella woah
thank god
this does see a little suspect given that it s coming on the heels of the whole alexander situation   bringhimback
yeah whatever happened to good old bwog  the one i knew and loved and stalked for overheards  i still remb alexander s piece for hte blue and white about his cis gender identity
the outpouring of support for alexander is telling of how well liked the rest were
when you do a job well you make enemies  but how much work did alexander even do
um
they ll never learn
rabble rabble rabble zionist conspiracy rabble rabble

this is also means we do nt have the loungescommunal spaces in nuss that we were expecting
the windows are that small because it prevents people from jumping out them when they find out they are living in a shitty dorm room for the rest of the year   thanksnsopgirl
way to trivialise mental illness
interestingly enough
they were all  100   students that took a semester off or studied abroad  when that happens
students who study abroad or take medical leave have guaranteed housing when they return
columbia needs to stop taking so many students
as for paying  9
they used to
yeah
barely livable to harry potter cupboardunderthestairs status  ie  125 to 105 sq  ft   125sqft is barely livable  what campus do you live on
those lounges really are dark though
you moved off campus
dammit siri
bwog needs a stronger editorial policy regarding reporting ancient history as if it is contemporary fact  very sloppy on your partthe headline re carman ceiling tiles falling was reported as current event
what
you know
ceiling cat
for a glory hole
why do the mcbain students keep plugging toilets
the fed has no room to lower rates  did you mean raise  they will not raise rates
what about gs
really
you do have to realize that the space was entirely paid for by seas and columbia college and the room was donated from the school of engineering  rather than complaining about and to seas and cc
that s information is not in the article
good for you guysi complained about the language though  mostly bwog s consistent tone of ignoring gsi ve been here 5 years almost and it s ridiculousalso
get out
lurking in the first pic
why barnard and gs students have to be up in arms about cc and seas students getting some things they dont  their schools definitely get some things that ours do not
woww   you have got to be kidding about barnard students not going to this institution  and in regards to you getting all butt hurt that gs and barnard are up in arms about not having access  the above comments are coming from gs students  where do you see barnard students complaining and automatically thinking everything is at our disposal
gs uses  your  study spaces  good lord
its called  the college library  for a reason
there goes another classroom
gon na fail  makerspaces have to be egalitarian and about communities of people  it s not a room full of tools
inventors club is preparing for its next major project and we need your support  we have launched a kickstarter campaign in order to raise  5
there s no other existing picture of her from the last ten years
tharp listed    beauty
for the past two years
this is the investigative journalism equivalent of putting on your dad s suit
yeah this is really fucking stupid
what was the point of this  no honestly
there s some weird assumptions about socioeconomic status and race in this post plus some weird liberal guilt  thanks for making black student callers feel just a little more awkward
however
in retrospect this sounds like i take it more seriously than i do
so the job is advertised as fun and meaningful but is nt
the point of this article was yet another attempt by a contributer to be anti columbia  as an alum i am really sick of these entries from students  the call center is a win win for everyone
this is a really ridiculous article  the information is inaccurate and only causes stress for people working at the call center  after bwog s  exposure  of  scandalous  events that occur at the calling center
hey
so if they did nt hire black students
but actually
i live offcampus and it worked for me  it seems like they re only checking if you have a  columbiaedu email address
i graduated and it worked for me  all hail the  columbiaedu address
someone delete these before they catch on to us
what else as columbia students do we get free that i might not know about
free software from cuit  free microsoft software if you have a cs account
free software from cuit  free microsoft software if you have a cs account
why does it expire after 24 hours

everybody needs to get in on amazon locker  you can get your packages delivered to rite aid and skip the shitshow that is the package center
you ve ruined our secret  what have you done
i sent my comment to the package center  it should be posted here soon
good post
it s always a disaster at the beginning of the semester
i do nt remember it being this bad before
building a system to handle x amount of packages 50 weeks out of the year and 100x two other weeks requires spending the same amount of money as doing 100x all the time  what   this math does nt check outthis is a systems design question not algebra  example  amazon manages to get  most  christmas time packages delivered on time and they sure as shit do nt operate at that load all year
yeah
hey
it s always a disaster at the beginning of the semester
i mean
i feel like it has nt been this bad in previous semesters  it s already been more than two weeks since school startedlooking on the bright side
if i recall correctly
bad
dear humor police
you moved off campus
i live off campus  yet i still send my mail to lerner  why have nt i realized the stupidity of this until just now  i mean i ve been waiting for an hour in a line when i have a perfectly fine mailbox in my building  i should probably hand back my admission letter
i found my package in one of those bins while waiting on line today so that was kinda cool  fyi its really easy to go through those 50 bins of everyones packages while you wait
really there should be multiple package centers designated on the basis of where someone lives
you re the reason i have trust issues
the above comment was in response to  i found my package in one of those bins while waiting on line today so that was kinda cool  fyi its really easy to go through those 50 bins of everyones packages while you wait
kevin chen you re adorable
but which kevin chen
other spoiler  manpower does nt have to be fixed  they can easily hire temp workers for the first 3 weeks
1  not always
and this comment was written by a computer
is  turring  a pun that i did nt catch
there is a reason why some people are going to columbia and some are working for columbia
ignoring the fact that this comment reeks of classism
i had to wait in a line
like everything else run by columbia
it s a ripoff of patrick
i miss anonamoose  hesheit always had nice comments
thanks
so much less bwog commenting this year  brings a tear to my eye
do nt ever go to a party again you fucking gdi
he s rushing beta from what i hear
nope he is not
thanks bro  appreciate the support
hysterical  bwog seems to have gotten a killer bunch of freshmen this year
first years
that s realized that these two comments are by the same person
this is horribly written and trails into a tangent about a girl taking pictures  wtf bwog
bwog
appears to be referring to an adp party as a frat party  unironicallyseems like a failure of bwog institutional memory to me
composed piece of intellect
god adp is annoying
interestingly enough
like
way to go team
if that part about the reporter is true
the tip that ra s have quotas is not true
ras having quotas  that s almost as silly as lithum teachers having standardized grading rubrics
and do nt forget about the cameras in every carman room   big brother sees everything
do nt worry
he did nt even go here
well
there are a lot of crazy people
hope we get it
where the fuck would we even put another library except in the new campus
there s a lot of unallocated land in the manhattanville project  it is being built up as funding is provided by the respective tenants  various schools and departments
columbia plans to put it on the manhattanville campus  the area includes sites for 1520 large buildings  one  or maybe two  would go to the obama library  that would nt require changing any plans
will there be a tram that runs between morningside and manhattanville campuses  are we just expected to take the subway or walk between the two
as reported in the nyt
yes
you re assuming a connection
a perfect choice  who else could he trust to bury administrative records and documents in obscurity and redtape
i d like us to win but find it unlikely considering he did nt live in nyc for very long and it s not his home state
i really hope columbia does nt get the library seriously this school needs to stop building and keep tuition flat
the library is entirely funded by the foundation through donations
crossing my joints
what i heard from some prominent folks in the administration a year or so ago is they were nt going to serious pursue it
there are several components to these plans  a presidential library
obama was raised in hawaii and was a state senator and a national senator from illinois  the only truly significant event he lived through in new york was his two year tenure at columbia as a college student
altho true
gag
what about ready for rand

ready for elizabeth warren
but wishing for warren
because of the ongoing
women have always been the primary victims of war  women lose their husbands
cu clubs were nt allowed to make explicit political endorsements  are these people just operating together
ready for canada
this is the worst thing ever  in so many ways  superpac  check  clinton  check  dysfunctional democracy  check

good old  surivor
stop occupying my plaza without consent   specsucks  clickbait  webonly
note how their facebook page says that 999 people went  looking at the pictures i guess that about 900 to 950 of them were not demonstrating but taking picturesway to blow up proportions
you must be a freshman or 40 years oldmost columbia parties have 3001000 people  going  and contain 30 peopleyou press going on all the events that you supportmay go to
despite what you have been told
that zoe was raped as she said  watch her cnn interview and notice the inconsistency in how she describes the claimed act   sexually assaultedgropedetc
fuck this movement  freetyson  innocent  noredtapesucksballs
just like the war on drugs  this war on rape is not working  just legalize it already
men rape  everyone knows this  why do we still ask survivors to prove that they were raped  no one would lie about this  the burden of proof should not apply in rape cases  men should have to prove that they are not rapists
that is an incredibly misguided point of view  either you are not from this country and do not yet understand our system of laws
the original poster was obviously trolling  he was indirectly accusing the activists of holding that point of view
it is entirely possible that an alleged rape victim truly believes he or she was raped
i am not trolling and i am serious  there is no such thing as a false accusation  rape is any time a woman can not give full
whereas your other points might be correct  forcible drinking to induce consent
you are certainly correct  i am straining very hard to understand how anyone could arrive at a conclusion as absurd as the notion that it is possible to be raped if you consent
i should also add that i really wonder how this university finds itself admitting people who are so lacking in critical thinking abilities that they think categorically
uh what you just described is the basis of one of the 3  rape  claims levied against the guy emma is accusing  he dated a girl for a bit
she described being pinned down forcefully and crying both during and after sex on multiple occasions  important  if your partner is in hysterics
surprise surprise
your satire is fucking brilliant and spot on    uh what you just described is the basis of one of the 3  rape  claims levied against the guy emma is accusing  he dated a girl for a bit

1 say you were raped2  give interviews to anyone who ll listen2  become famouswrite op eds meet a bunch of famous people3     4  profithey zoe
interesting how many feminists patrol this site downvoting all dissenting opinions
yep  i m doing that
well
if a kangaroo court doesnt find the person you accused responsible
or does that message on the mattresses look like it was put together by a  a la pretty little liars  xoxo bitches
as a man
thanks captain obvious  these girls are ugly as shit anyway  that s mainly the reason why they re where they are hell hath no fury like an ugly bitch scorned
does  no red tape  mean no due process for defendants  or is due process part of rape culture
it s also laughable that  sexual violence  can be completely eliminated   gendered  crimes like sexual assault and domestic violence are the only crimes libs talk about in terms of  ending  or  should never happen
is it laughable to talk about ending poverty
as a woman
are you implying that if a girl were to be impaired and taken advantage of
are you trolling  i ca nt tell because i m sober so feel free to explaini know you ca nt consent when incapacitated by alcohol
are you familiar with people who black out and have no recollection of the events of the night before
whoever was raped should know that they have universal sympathy and support  rape is one of the most serious crimes
this is a complete non sequitur  no one is arguing that rape is nt heinous or that it should nt be prosecuted fullythe debate is over whether we should throw due process to the winds and expel a student who has been exonerated by the judiciary and whose accuser would rather engage in a histrionic mattress protest than actually try to pursue the case via law enforcement  keep in mind that this student
that s exactly what i said
rape
guilty until proven innocent
guilty even though proven innocent
let s forget the fact that people think that these survivors are speaking out for fame  is this movement not powerful solely because it is putting a fire under the behinds of columbia administration  everyone deserves statistics and everyone deserves a safe campus  we should nt allow them to hide things from us or slide by because columbia is an  ivy   this issue is bigger than us  so many other students at other schools have filed title ix lawsuits  this issue branches out farther than college walk  as an institute of higher education
traaaaaaaack
imagine some poor azn who worked his ass off to get into an ivy

story of my fucking life  affirmative action  barnard is the root problem here  columbia let dumbasses into the school
1  you completely just equated people having a discussion about rape  people who have survived rape and assault to  being dumbasses  2  affirmative action was nt even briefly mentioned in any of the comments and you brought it up  your bitter racism is showing and it s vile3  i hope you get trapped in a cave in and have to eat centipedes for the rest of your puny life
these are some of the most troubling comments i ve seen discussing rape  from all sides  on any internet fora  which is saying something  i would be deeply ashamed to have or have had the authors of some of these comments as my student
im so glad i already graduated from this shitty school  you should give your radical students all f s so they know what to expect upon entering the real world
an overwhelming number of commentators understand and appreciate principles of due process  they reject lynch mobs  they question purposeless protesting  they value facts over mere statements  they stand apart from hysterical rhetoric  that s refreshing  it s columbia
this demonstration at lowe was nt in any form screaming  we hope all rapists get expelled and crucified immediately
i am sorry but everything the cu activists do sounds to me like they absolutely hate all men  here s one slogan that really pisses me off  men rape   we
there s a sign in the back that says  capitalism and patriarchy engender rape  let s send these idiots and their puppet master crit lit professors to the worker s paradise of north korea
can someone please explain what is happening with the protesters and the administration  what exactly are the protesters asking forprotesting  i see  more transparency and more programs  but what exactly does this mean  i have also heard no mention of svr  sexual violence response  which is accessible by anyone and is staffed 247  someone please explain because i m getting lost in the sea of articles and none of them seem to give any detail whatsoever
read the letter bwog linked to  it explains in detail what they are asking for  it should be noted that they are asking for more and better due process
help me out here  i m a little confused  i am entirely sympathetic with the victims of assault and rape  i am also totally committed to the notion of due process  is there some reason why the nypd is considered an inappropriate agency for addressing the need for justice  do the alleged victims have a reason for not reporting assaults and rapes to the police as a first step in the legal process  what compels the university to insert itself in this process  why are nt all allegations referred to the police  the sex crimes unit was initially begun under the leadership of linda fairstein
because there is no real crime here  this isnt about getting raped  this is about deciding 2 years after the fact that you didnt actually like the guy and reporting him as a rapist
survivors      how many men have sex in alcoholic circumstances that they would not choose to if sober with females they would not choose if they were sober  i have seen this happen  yet men do not have the privilege of turning the morning after regret into a law suit  the stupid idiot the night before transforms into the innocent victim the morning after in a cinderella type transformation  that privilege is reserved for women alone  that is sexism
this is true  i recently spoke with a women who worked in a rape crisis center and she said that about 50  of people coming in reporting sexual harassment and assault were men  this too
to be clear
to all those who spoke and bravely shared your stories  thank you  i thank you as a survivor who does nt have the courage to do what you all did
rebels without a cause
thank you

am i the only one excited for the beer or what

this article sucks  what about those furnald 8 parties   in 824    you didnt get the whole story
two people hanging out drinking filched coke from jj s ai nt a party
lol  cman s attempts
this is dumb
there writing clearly indicates they go to barnyard
i love this  and the wild thornberries was the shit

bwog comments  yik yak
b  b    bwog comments  yik yak
was a great find so funny
bwog these are great
we do
how is an all poc section okay  if i started an all white section that d be blatantly racist
that
lol presumably the other section will  or could  be all white
omg ya  and y is it ok to have bet  black entertainment channel  but not a white entertainment channel    isnt that racist
black people ca nt be racist
i came here looking for boooooooty
not sure if trying to be ironic or actually that stupid
as a sophomore you would think that youd have learned about reverse racism by now  bummer 4 u
why is bwog publishing press releases from otherwise nonnewsworthy organizations  what s special about femsex
because bwog has done that literally since its beginning
for the poster above asking why a poc group  why not one  different people have different perspectives on ordinary stuff
yep
so long as we are nt defining  deal with diversity  as  minority groups only get to gather where the majorities can keep tabs on em
ooooh
i m a little bit confused as how publishing a general announcement about femsex   misdirected activism   especially since it s possible that someone at femsex contacted bwog and asked them to publish the post
lovely gesture
i commend the cucr peeps for taking the time to do something to commemorate the lives lost
not everything is a potential tool for multicultural promotion  i m far from a patriot
it s unnecessary to couch grief over 911 in irrational proamerican nationalism  especially when that same nationalism not long ago was used as a pretext to violate the constitution and start a horrific warwe ought to view today not as a day when americans died
are why columbia is not the real world  do nt use this day as a platform for your political ideology  we are remembering the americans that lost their lives less than 10 miles from campus
to be fair
all of the time
beautiful gesture
who is going to dispose of them after midnight
i kept the flags from last year and we will do the same again
this is welcome
disappointed by the palestinian flag waver at the reading of names  there are 364 other days to protest
you a freshman  because get used to it
but so did hundreds of terrorists  do you think sjp is leaving out their names
ca nt understand why sjp is doing this today  lets let 911 just be about 911  to do anything else is to disrespect every life that was lost
i m pretty sure that 911 is a really shitty day to have a  free palestine  demonstration on campus  oooh so edgy reading off names of dead palestinians in the middle of campus on 911  i m not surprised though  congratulations
one of the rare instances where i m on the same page as cucr  bravo
can we just hotbox this
narnia
onedimensional  is a line segment  squares are twodimensional
also you can tell it s not two dimensional looking straight on from the shadow
dumb article
back in my day
never change
yawn
seconded
do you even go here
you have to take into account the probability of both twins being accepted which would be highly unlikely
you re calculating for the number of individuals who are twins
right it would nt be 25  times the population
bwog  you are really going down hill this semester lol
bwog needs to take a statistics class before writing posts like these
this was literally cringeworthy from top to bottom  probably the exact opposite of funny
pass frosci  backoftheenvelopeftw
thank u for hashtagging
bwog
my twin and i were class of 2012 i m just gon na assume we got in because there were nt enough twins yet
dean wong is not your friend      rise up      power to the people      free palestine      free calamine      free asinine
what about ferguson  bwog you suck
he was accused of murdering his girlfriend and found not guilty  he most definitely shot his girlfriend
so i m fairly well versed in the whitesavior complex and how it impacts teaching
the other side is a caucasian student raising her hand
bwog is really shitty this year  stop trying so hard to be edgy activists and go back to being funny but informative
racial insensitivity white privilege rape culture trigger warning heteronormative
why ya always tryna start shit

are you suggesting these two things are comparable
i m so triggered right now
as a former ci coordinator
cool story
han you re the best
well put
the best ra ever
how are there so many white conservatives who comment on bwog who ca nt see what s wrong with this  first everybody trashing emma and now this  or are you all one person
me thinks you should stop looking for ways to be offended and finish the fuckin illiad
i love how  antiracist  people always reveal their implicit racism when they do things like this  how wonderful it is that you assume that all people who teach in that organization are white and that ci was specifically targeting white people to become teachers by telling them to  take up the white man s burden  and not students of all races  that s an utterly ridiculous and unfair assumption and also is blatantly false  that seems to indicate to me that it is you who is injecting racism into the situation
wow
way back in the woodstein days
how come you did nt report on the portrayal of the other person on the other side  that s not fair  but its bwog  no one cares
way to completely strip the image of all context in a blatant effort to stir shit
why is it questionable  what
hypersensitivity much  i love calling people out on their problematic shit as much as the next columbian
next week  tipster finds ci has a cutout of a white kid  headline  race complex
did you know that 1 in 5 cardboard cutouts will be inappropriately touched without their consent during their lifetimes
shity sensationalist bwog  you re getting tips now from  informants   what are you  a college paper or cia
this is demeaning to me
if your  tipster  had bothered to talk to those volunteers about the sign
that just means that ci is full of male saviors too  sarcasm
bwog
but today was not the day
all lives are the same that is the point of reading the names today  very easy for americans to ignore the reality of death when is not a daily reality and only happens once a year  we
so disrespectful
but so were hundreds of terrorists  is sjp leaving out the names of hamas terrorists killed
i think you need to redefine your ideas of what constitutes  terrorist   what happened on 911 and what happened in gaza are by no means comparable  your also erring on the side of islamophobic so watch it maybe
indiscriminately shooting rockets at neighboring territories is in fact terrorism and blowing up these launch points is in fact counter terrorism
just to get things straight
schools where hamas was firing rockets from and where hamas was using human shields to try and protect themselves  also fun fact 15th of the missles hamas fires do nt make it to israel and land in palestinian territory killing their own people there too  attacking enemy combatants is nt terrorism attacking civilian population centers on purpose is
dsadsa  truth is that rockets do land on civilian territory in israel  you clearly were nt there this summer
knowingly dropping 20
either the israelis were nt trying to kill civilians
are they including the names and ages of killed israelis
i do nt think so  it just looks bad on their part if you ask me
there were 2 or 3 israeli civilian casualties compared to over 2
were there not enough israeli deaths for you  how selfish of them
how many israelis would ve died if the iron dome wasnt there  definitely more than in gaza  so shut up and look at both sides of the story
if israel is so good at defending itself

great that they are reading names and ages of the victims in gaza  really highlights the barbarism of hamas using all those civilians as shields and hiding their weapons in schools and hospitals
dare they  it s 9 fucking 11
since when is the memorialization of one tragedy considered disrespectful to another
during the commemoration of the lives lost in the biggest attack on american soil since the founding of this country  the focus of this day was not the middle east but those that passed at the hands of terrorismin the aftermath of the events that day in ny
the death of civilians in gaza is abominable but the attention it receives is absurdly disproportionate  if they cared just as much about the civilians currently dying in eastern syria and western iraq at the hands of isis and other militia they d have to spend a few weeks there reciting all names
and today there s neither
sjp organized this vigil in accordance with a national solidarity movement worldwide  they are reading out the names of lives lost and victims of warfare  that is not to undermine the mourning of victims of 911  on the contrary
there s nothing about respect here  if their concern was mourning the loss of life
there s any particular reason why this so called  international solidarity movement  picked today  or was that just you guys  fucking bastards
palestinians were celebrating on 911  they support terrorists and many terrorists are palestinianthey get no sympathy from me  in fact
and it looks like it s you
wow sjp
i totally respect if this group wants to bring attention to people killed in gazahowever
it shows you who is childish enough to abuse it  the support and respect i used to give sjp is now gone  nicely done
sjp is now officially the biggest joke of a student group on campus
are they still there   500 pm
spirit of 68  tag  really  clearly unfamiliar with 68
it d be one thing if this was the only day they could get the sundial
cant help but laugh at this picture
learn a thing from b  b
but
i hope they get cancer
they bitched to blog  i have a screenshot and it s still on bwog s facebook page  you should take a screenshot too
why blur them out  if you shout into a bullhorn in the middle of campus
i see nothing hateful  we re piss
there s nothing you really have to say about sjp  the fact that they only have 4 members present out of the entire school says enough  add to it
if they have the audacity to read these names on 911  many of them undoubtedly terrorists  have the guts to show your faces  the blacked out faces make it farcical  serves them well  how ridiculous do they look
check bwog s facebook wall
a little tasteless
they hijacked 911
911 was hijacked
a tasteless act yes   wrong day  but it should not ever be used to overshadow the injustice  war crimes  that took place in gaza this summer and years before  i ca nt believe all the hate and name calling on here
i m really sick of this conflict that i personally have done absolutely nothing to support either way getting shoved in my face by both parties  as far as i am concerned
i support the civilians in gaza but shame on you sjp  we are a university of nyc  many alumni
sjp could have chosen any one of the other 364 to hold this demonstration  today is not just about civilian deaths  it is about a very specific event that shook our city and our country thirteen years ago  if the sjp s goal was to bring attention to civilian deaths

i wan na know who you are so i can marry you
so israel was supposed to let gaza shoot rockets just like that  like

taking an article thats dated from two years ago is irrelevant  the whole point of the article is to talk about this summer  and this summer
oh wait  hamas did kidnap the teens
do nt know where you got that piece of information man
over 51 days  with us funding the sky s the limit
can we get an article  a source proving that  and even so

why is my money being used for israel  israel should use its own money  why is my money being used for gaza  gaza should use its own money  if they want anything from us

the bias in these comments is fucking laughable  looks like hillel flooded bwog today
asshole
is wonderful and you are stupid
you could learn a thing or two from that kid
man you re so right
did that kid read any israeli names  probs not
rekt
that kid was probably brain washed since he was a kid  not his fault he turned into an ass
nice that they sent out an email to show they take sexual assault seriously
do nt rape
did any barnard student receive this email  does nt this affect barnard students
attractive  thoughtfull article
vp of communications abby porter gave more specifics about her plan to poll students  she admitted her polls are not going to be representative of everyone at columbia  and will not be scientific  her hope is to survey as many students as possible at student gathering places
i love
blowhards  that was the best you could come up with  weak  also fuck you
favorite part  that bailinson and his lackeys think sending a collegewide email and changing the name of the meetings will attract a larger audience in the futurei m sorry

she should step down immediately  why delay it  disgraceful
i think our president is starting to understand that we want winning teams  if we are going to compete we should do it well

two words  silicon valley

i wo nt steal arsene wenger s thunder by pointing out that 4th place is pretty much a trophy itselfdoes this mean we have to face off against a turkish university to qualify for the university champions league
suck it besiktas
who cares  at least this means we ll have less obnoxious kids applying just for rank   roarlionroar
why not also cover this metric of school quality  economic diversity  a category in which columbia and barnard both perform really well
because economic diversity has nothing to do with how good a school is and every school has some poor people
we would be one if gs were not included in our stats  no other school counts their continuing ed students
i know
i do nt think gs is included in the stats
gs is not included in the stats  only cc and seasgs students might have lower stats and not as academically qualified as the real undergrads
lol  real  undergrads
gs is not included in the stats  plus
gs is a liberal arts college like cc
hahahaha
the methodology is garbage  i know because i go to this school and it sucks
must be so pissed  p
per usnews  columbia s three undergraduate schools are used in the calculation
4th  but  1 in rape
of course the methodology is questionable  they ve got a top 3 that s predetermined
princeton now has a higher admit rate than like the top 8 schools  i am not sure why princeton is still in the top five  stanford has a low admit rate
its sat scores are due to its athletes
in us news and world report
given all of the attention finally focused on the number of sex assault and harass complaints filed against schools in usa
cu was not named in the doj s list of title ix violators  u of chicago was

this is what columbia means when they say they are working on real change  they work very hard to find new ways to brush rape under the rug

what do people think columbia could have done  columbia investigated
so fucking entitled  does she think people will just get imprisoned on a whim  does she not understand that under the us constitution
i agree that she ca nt expect this man to be expelled  too much time went by and there was nt enough evidence to properly punish him  all they have is her word and that is nt enough so they let him off  not unreasonable  the police would have done exactly the same thing  but it s important to realize that if she really feels unsafe and is being triggered by his presence
of course shed feels unsafe in his presence  not that she thinks that he would do anything to her  can you imagine accusing someone for something he did nt do
so if someone felt unsafe around an african american or muslim student who was not found guilty of any wrongdoing
absolutely not
yes
i m just curious whyif beog trusts this tipster  assuming that s where this flyer came from   i find it nearly impossible to believe 1  that the alumni office would get the name of the university it fucking raises money for wrong
bwog
the flyer is real
yeah
columbia s fundraising is outsourced to a company called ruffalocody  most of our fundraising materials come from them
i can also attest that this is a real flyer  again
i work there too

i actually thought this had some potential  the chart
did someone lift this from seventeen magazine
or can no one read the graphic
seriously who the hell is writing for bwog this year   this is the dumbest article i ve read in a long time and is turning into a borderline conspiracy theory site  jesus get your sht together bwog
after 12 hours of water boarding potential suspects
some people say the upside of paranoia is the little egorush that comes from clearly being important enough to have all those forces arrayed against you  if that was too subtle  what on earth are these clubs doing that someone would want to spy on
making guillotines  which bwog and spec have ignored   if cucr did a fake gun demonstration
you have been giving this way too much coverage  let s move on to something else
welcome to bwog where the front page is always rape
the other two complaints against emma s rapist was that he was an abusive boyfriend  he did nt pay for dates
who the fuck looks at google reviews when considering colleges
deantini sent an email to alums this morning  that s an official response if i ve ever seen one
nice edit
yeah
the students are only hurting themselves in the long run by posting fake bad reviews of their school  everyone knows they are fake
this girl needs to check her privilege  i have a friend who did not get columbia housing and is living on a park bench in riverside  he would kill to have a mattress and she is just carrying it around wasting it while others suffer
although she had the funds to purchase the mattress herself
bwog only tries to jump on the bandwagon columbia spectator has started with their biased reporting and with taking on the role of emma s press officer  when does it stop that shaming a person off campus who has nt been found guilty by two investigations is considered a legitimate action by student media  none of the socalled  journalists  ever tries to even ask a question about the plausibility of her claims
interesting thoughts  by the way  has anyone noticed that according to deantini s mail it is a matter of free speech
is that it s not libelslander unless you can definitely prove a rape did not take place  on both sides of the line there exists reasonable doubt so while it s hard to find him guilty for rape
track bewildered  standfordueprocessi would bet a handsome sum that you re the same person who was agreeing with himherself while casting aspersions on emma on the other thread  under the pseudoyms florencesoniawhy do you need people to agree with you so badly that you d try to pass yourself off as multiple people
has anyone ever noticed that tracking works with your public ip address  so if you re at a public computer in butler and you post something and later someone posts something from a computer using the same gateway
should read   a new ip address
oops
check
yes
and everyone writing about it in a positive way gets plenty of applause  you even get internships and jobs with real life media that are hyping the topic
who s the dipshit bwog writer who ca nt hop off emma s dick  we get that you really want to be an armchair activist
i will be walking around campus for the rest of my senior year with a backpack at all times  i ll take 1 art degree plz
all the activists outraged by emma s rape have nothing to worry about no man would ever rape them
what all this bad publicity is doing is making it seem like this man was clearly an obvious rapist and that the university is trying to protect him
guy in photo looks like robert downey jr

good for public safety  sweeping these hateful incidents under the rug harms everyone involved
but does it do more harm than the incidents themselves

you re right  what do you recommend to fix the problem  no more jews with positions of power  no jobs for jews  perhaps we should send them somewhere camps maybe  or perhaps there s another way to get rid of them  odd how easy it is to get from a to b
anonymous  no i do nt condone oppression of jews or people of other faiths  your baseless assumptions are typical of the type of scaremongering associated with fox news
huh i never considered myself a racist person

i m curious too  jts
because1  history is not irrelevant here  there s a long history of people using statements like this as an excuse to do bad things to jews2  jews are a tiny part of the country  about 22   the suggestion that they control the us has a menacing implication  that we re being dominated by some small and nonrepresentative group
this is why no one thinks art majors take college seriously  she literally just bought a mattress  her interpretation makes total sense  i understand that
the average college dormissue mattress weighs fifty pounds
great effort
i think this is representative of a great performance art
i want to think this whole thing is theater made up as part of the  performance art  because she s not willing to carry the torch   it got transferred to the district attorneys office
thank you so much for saying this  people want to vilify anyone that does nt consider dragging a mattress around revolutionary art but there are legitimate questions to be asked about the conversation being had about sexual assault on this campuswhy
despite what you have been told
the attention began immediately
i think people seriously need to rethink the myth that nobody is listening to rape victims  this has gone viral across the globe
it would take up to nine months or a year for it to go to court  by then i would have graduated
could nt have said it any better myself
yeah its not like they are purposely waiting to prosecute her case
i totally agree  i smell a rat
by the time the trial even went through she would have graduated feeling unsafe and who knows what kind of effect that can have on her  i know if something like that happened to me i d want to forget about it  having to occupy yourself with what would probably be one of the most horrific experiences of your life during a time that you re applying to grad school
you can defend her all you want
why does the victim have the responsibility to keep him
i m sorry
surely you recognize that for someone both studying performance art
what is she expecting to happen  the administration already went through the judicial process with the defendant and came to a decision  whether you agree with the decision or not  or whether it was the correct one  is another issue
at that point
man
all i can say is
i like how currently a third of the comments have all been written by the same person
that s right  that s all me and i am shaming emma  and feeling sorry for her at the same time  for falsely accusing a guy 2 years after the alleged incident  i am shaming her for not filing charges when she was able to prove something  i am shaming her for paralyzing social life at columbia with her bullshit game  i am shaming all of you who are supporting her unconditionally and calling for this guy s imprisonment
soniaflorence  jeanpaul nungesser
good job
plot twist  emma sulkowicz
plot twist  we are all elves
by the time the trial even went through she would have graduated feeling unsafe and who knows what kind of effect that can have on her  i know if something like that happened to me i d want to forget about it  having to occupy yourself with what would probably be one of the most horrific experiences of your life during a time that you re applying to grad school
yeah
yeah
if only we had this impartial third party we could go to investigate these crimes
did you not notice that the first responder told her the rape was consensual because they had sex before  putting aside emma s response to a traumatic event
well she seems to have no problem bar hopping in morningside without her mattress and without very much clothing on
yeah

it could be such a let down for many of us if the  bar hopping  comment is true
it s pretty worrying how eager some people are to throw out due process when the accusation being made is sufficiently emotional  at this point we do nt know that emma was raped  many people may decide to believe she was
correction  we as a society believe it s better to let a guilty white man go than to punish an innocent one  do nt forget this privilege does nt exist across all demographics  for example
thanks
are you children being serious right now  this has nothing to do with race
where due process does nt exist or was thrown over board
interesting fact  the other 2 assault complaints were not for rape  despite what all media sources are claiming  one was the suspect s ex girfriend who claimed he emotionally abused her
but she says
end your fing parentheses  damnit columbia
she was partying last night and she did nt have her mattress    how lame
interesting fact  the other 2  sexual assault  complaints were not about rape  one was from an ex girlfriend of the alleged offender
to everyone saying she is selfish and cowardly for not focussing all her effort into a trial
you know the accused comes from an incredible wealthy family and that money wins trials   uhh emma went to the dalton school
you should nt assume she s incredibly wealthy because she went to a prep school  i went to a prestigious prep school on 80  financial aid and i m on financial aid here as well  if i were in emma s situation
rape is a criminal charge
read  school is number 25
and tbh regardless of whether you think the accused is guilty or not  something that only he and emma can ever really know without a doubt at this point
another shitforbrains member of the newest adult generationwhich is the biggest indicator of her stupidity  1  choice of major  yeah
physically
it s taken three weeks to write a ten page paper
pitchfork  in seriousness
i think it is very powerful
by the way  can anyone explain to me what the difference is between asking for help and repeating over and over again on national tv and print media that you re not allowed to ask for help but you are allowed to accept help  i almost feel coerced to help her
a lot of you seem to think that our criminal justice system is flawless  reporting to the police does not automatically mean justice  and doing something constructive while you wait for the prosecutor to get on your case does not mean that you are nt still going to work with them  do nt know if she is
but her statements certainly do nt make it seem as though she s  waiting for the prosecutor to get on the case   all the info we ve been given so far seems to indicate that she has dropped the casestopped working with the nypd entirely  the criminal justice system certainly is nt flawless
get my rapist off campus  is nt that simple  this man was proven innocent by the columbia judicial system  why  because when you report a rape 8 months after it occurs
i think a lot of people posting comments on these pages are missing the point of emma s protestshe is protesting the fact that women who are victims of rape and sexual assault on her collegel campus are treated as if they are  invisible   their claims are swept under the rug in grossly negligent proceedings that should never have been held at a university because of their conflict of interest in protecting their imageby carrying the mattress emma is forcing the university and equally importantly the faculty and other students to recognize what happened with her and discuss this issueas for her alleged assailant he was accused of attacking two other womenthe school newspaper published his name because they felt alleged attacks on three women was sufficient basis to protect other womenalso just as an aside a lawsuit against a college student majoring in visual studies isnt going to earn you any money
she is doing it
seems to me that emma s work would have been better presented as an effort to force the university and its students to address the issue of rape and sexual assault on campus instead of sweeping it under the rug and making its victims invisible instead of directly calling for her alleged attacker to be expelled as she already went through all possible channels to have him brought to justice and lost in part because of the passage of time before bringing the chargesby dragging her mattress across campus she refuses to be invisible and forces the university and its students into a constructive dialogue on this issueshe should be focusing her protest on the failure to receive a fair hearing and to be treated fairly instead of the end result which is to have her attacker expelled  who i understand is studying abroad this year anyway  i think her action is a very effective tool at forcing the issue upon the university and its students as demonstrated by the national and international attention it has broughtas for all of the people claiming she is at risk of being sued for defamation or slander that is patently false  that would require the accused to bring an action in court where the caes would turn on whether she was in fact raped and he is never going to be able to prove she was nt raped in a civil court i can assure you as a civil court lawyer  that question doesnt turn on whether the campus authorities or the police dropped her case  it would have to be examined again in the civil court
wait he s not actually on campus in the first place    hahahahahahhahaahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahhahahahaaahahaahahhahaahhahahahahahhahahahahah
stop the victimblaming comments plz it is outrageous
who are the victims you re talking about  who gets to call victims  victims  and brand people  rapists   no one is blaming real victims but something tells us that we smell a rat in the latest columbia rape hysteria  you are a part of it
how many men have sex in alcoholic circumstances that they would not choose to if sober with females they would not choose if they were sober  i have seen this happen  yet men do not have the privilege of turning the morning after regret into a law suit  the stupid idiot the night before transforms into the innocent victim the morning after in a cinderella type transformation  that privilege is reserved for women alone  that is sexism
after reading e s  story
i m not sure why but this website is loading very slow for meis anyone else having this issue or is it a problem on my end  i ll check back later on and see if the problem still exists
hello it s me
in reviewing this and various other articles about this matter
i could nt refrain from commenting  well written
mattress piece theater
oh
this is something that s been bothering me for a while  a lot of people who talk about sexual assault here tend to focus on date rape  how the hell does that even happen  every time i get shitfaced and come back to columbia public safety practically interrogates me  hell
hello   there are nt guards every where where this can happen  i have gone to a party off campus  wcolumbia people  and had my drink spiked  thank god nothing happened to me but this is just one of many ways a poor soul can be date raped
well obviously
is great  i m glad the administration is taking consent education more seriously
consensual sexual activity requires unambiguous communication   have nt these people ever taken a communication studies course  there s literally no such thing as completely unambiguous communication  human expression is always subject to some degree of interpretation

my classes are there but i ca nt add any  idk barnard what are you doing
guys this happens sometimes it always comes back stop freaking out
it s broken again
my classes disappearedthen returnedthen disappeared again
they do nt even go here   jk i  3 all yall barnard folks  hope your schedules work out
this did nt even happen  it was probably only a few students
went throughs the whole thing andstill nothing about the penalties for false accusations
is there ever a penalty for false accusations  i mean
falsifying a police report
slander
it s true
there should probably be penalties for true accusations before we worry about false accusations
false accusations for instances of sexual assault occur on a very minimal level  the percentage is no higher than any other crime at 13   additionally
and every other crime goes to a real court where a real trial occurs and a real verdict is reached
that number is garbage and you know it  maybe for violent rapes  where are you even getting this stat anyway  curious
it s 8 percent  keep in mind
is there some definitive guide to consent somewhere we can all follow  the more people i talk to the more i realize we all have very different definitions of consent  for example
it s really messed up that someone would think that would be ok
our administration has been overrun by lying gypsies

i do nt know the full story
cool story  it was an approved event regardless
the use of the space was approved  the event was not  huge difference

okay yes it s a  celebrity scandal

and i thought i was going to have to actually buy toilet paper this week  thanks leftwing activists
it s incredibly disappointing to see important activist groups on campus  no red tape and sws stand out
whoever
shoot you re right  i think i meant to go in a different direction with that sentence but got distracted and left the  whomever  in placeor maybe i was rebelling against settler colonialism  somehow
it is hard to take no red tape seriously if they are part of disorientation  we need a group that works to solve problems with the administration  not a group that never trusts and is never willing to accept the value of the admisistrationalso
palestinians are semites too
stop turning a semitic discussion in a semantic one
i did nt know columbia hired shills to do their bidding on these silly online forums
also biggest joke in the sjp writeup here   or just ignore the zionists yelling racial slurs at our stand   hahahaha you ca nt be serious  lionpac literally stands there silent because sjp just makes themselves look stupid with all those  not another nickel not another dime  crappy cheerleader chants
i hate sjp but those chants are so catchy

regardless of whether or not you agree with the opinions expressed in this document
bbut proper grammatical structures are patriarchal institutions
language is oppression
what total trash
does the section of the disorientation guide inviting students to liberate  themselves by joining a hiking club strike anyone else as hilariously out of place
this is actually terrorism
99  of us like it and appreciate it herefreshperson detectedthat being said
this is actually terrorism  no
actually it is  the  student activists  only want their point of view heard and want silence the administration and everyone else  they want 100  of their demands and language met
yeah
the tone of this
love how columbia kids take themselves sooo seriously like they actually matter
i actually think this year s was worse than the past  note the section on administrators  still titled  smiles and lies  from 2002    the art of war  with your administration  1always find out who has the final say
that is actually pretty good  may i add an impromptu  7  whatever you re fighting for
you mean like creating a fall welcome bacch concert aimed at promoting positive change on our campus including increased education about sexual assault and bystander intervention  we tried that
we chose not to name individuals for the sake of solidarity   when you cloak yourself as the vox populi
reaction  silence
if leftist want to shoot themselves in the foot
dear columbians
scanning the list of comments to the recent publication of the disorientation guide
you all are at an ivy league school
while it was an interesting read with some good points  and others that i personally disagreed with
thank you
i think the idea of this is nt to say that the people going into these fields are terrible
i m a selfidentified leftist and i think this guide is tryhard
lol
if you take time to actually fight to defend a narcissist
every one of those groups  including no red tape  shame on them for basically becoming the sex wing of the campus socialists  was willing to call out capitalism as  abusive   seriously catch a boat to cuba  you will be much happier there
the sex wing of the campus socialists  dafuq does that even meanand also
you have clearly never actually dealt with the administration
no red tape and co will chant and picket about  my pussy

are we just not going to talk about the rape at pike  really bwog you re going to praise and promote them instead of talking about how they roofie people  we all know it happened
actually retarded  or just an alumnus of the collegeacb class of two thousand and fuckwit
stop spreading untrue rumors  making up stories does nothing to help the fight against sexual assault
pics
is nt this what we have real news for  stick to columbiamorningside reporting

columbia has rape tourette s
i do nt know what to say about the administration at this school anymore  it s hopelessly pathetic
not the first time she s sent the wrong email to someone  earlier this year
george joseph is an amazing campus activist
total conflict of interesthe s not a reporter
yea i wish he had nt decided to publish this at all  would have been better for him just to sit on this and keep his activist constitution pure
loldid you see the guardian piece  too late for thatthe thing is
i second the comment about reading comprehension skills on behalf of the 22 people who upvoted this  it s not the final adjudication decision
am i the only one who finds this not that horrible  the official
but the rape activists do nt care about due process  they care about showing they can assert power and get on the news  it s all an ego trip for them
you need to read carefully before you post comments   some people do nt understand why an accuser ca nt be part of a final decisionmaking process   that was nt even the issue at hand  please retake lit hum then come back
katrina
the student then emailed administrators to ask that
the decision about the content of the spreadsheetnot about determination of responsibility or sanctioning
for virginia ryanseriously
fire her ass
who are the decision makers
actually had to go back and reread to realize that one line email was the subject of the scandal   come on guys  can only imagine what they d do with a for real salacious leaked email
i think activists should nt feel so entitled to administrators  time when it s a lot to expect
yeah
this is dumb  least scandaless scandal ever
this whole absurd  story  is exactly like many of  note  not all  the others surrounding this issue for the last year on campus  the email recipients were glad to get this email because it becomes a chip for them  they want the admins to release all of that  data  because they hope and assume there will be stinky stuff in it that they can wave around to press the admins to further tilt the scales toward  survivors   i respect people who want a better campus and educational experience
this  thank you
that is ridiculous  if they were so  glad  to get this email
nsop
nsop
holding onto an embarrassing email  for the admins
that does nt change anything about the content of virginia s message
one lowlevel admin definitely represents an entire bureaucracy  this whole story is steaming bull shit
actually she was recently promoted to barnard general counsel
you know why i m here
if there was an article for every rude email sent from an administrator to a student leader
between cu admins using  rape culture  as an excuse to cancel bacchanal and the reality of their annoyance with the pervasive activists is pretty revealing  it tells us what we already knew  cu only cares about its image
the ryan email needs to be forwarded to the ocr senior investigator and attorney as addendum to case file  it is evidence  ryan has just opened your case
you have a 90 day jurisdictional timeline  you have until september 5 th to submit this email and ask for investigation into violations of the administration of title ix  ocr will require training and place columbia under sanction and monitoring  90 days from may 5 th  if your complainant has been denied or administratively closed resubmit with this ryan email  should you require assistance i am glad to help

i think it is hard bc nsop is such a flurry of activities and pressure to find partiesfriends etc  or at least i felt so  to escape the loneliness that i was a little disappointeddisillusioned  just my take
these are so depressing  i had a great experience  i made tons of friends and had blast  i finally felt like an adult  i miss having fun and walking around campus with no responsibility
nsop was amazing  i will never forget how great it was  great times  101
fhritp
claire ur amazing so glad we are friends and closer than you and ur fan
i m glad bwog posted these accounts
what s your source on the victim not being cu student
seems like all information is coming from a random young adult fiction author tweeting at bwog   and nope
tweeting that they were killed seems really irresponsible
yeah but they kinda admit they do nt know the full story yet seems like they would nt go off some random twitter account alone
condolences   be careful guys
i heard it was a drunk nsoper
unfortunately
sybill trelawney has predicted the death of a student every year since she came to this school  none of them have died yet

it s a blood sacrifice to the dark gods ensuring prezbo never goes bald
why s bwog reporting about a random guy that got hit by a car
was not a columbia student  that was confirmed by police
thanks deblasio  they lowered the speed limit on broadway
there is so much pedestrian and car traffic on bway and amsterdam near columbia  it is time for some change to slow down trafficthis is two pedestrians hit on amsterdam ave and 116th and 115th in the last ten days  columbia must work with nyc and the mayor to make some changes for safetyone of the initiatives of the new mayor is to reduce pedestrian fatalities in the city

well that is an exciting first night  i believe most of us were the people that simply got drunk on nikolai and passed out in the lounge

i very rarely comment on bwog but this is an extremely depressing outlook on nsop
i agree  another sophomore
another one bites the dust
ok i meant from another sophomore
lighten up
it does nt seem that depressing to me  but more importantly
i do nt think anyone who brags about being from buffalo would be wearing axe deodorant and drinking nikolai  they would be wearing no deodorant and drinking a 40 oz

they officially gave up rebranding seas as ce  i think it had something to do with the appearance of trying to isolate gs and barnard   this is columbia engineering
um it definitely had to do with no one adopting it because it s dumb as shit and seas is much easier to say
it s because ce is the school of continuing education and nobody noticed the conflict  seas is still branded as  columbia engineering  rather than  school of engineering and applied science  when the words are spelled out
this whole  ce  thing literally was a complete lie  it started when a student affairs staff member made up the abbreviation in a letter to incoming students and did nt bother to actually check with anyone at seas first  since prefrosh devour any information sent to them and take it as canon
cps is very easy to mistake for columbia psychological services

this is all so helpful because everyone at columbia being drunk and miserable for 4 years is so hilarious  and it is also great because everyone knows that so many people being drunk beyond coherence 3 nights a week has nothing to do with gender misconduct  the one real tradition at columbia  lonely

do employers know that columbia school of general studies is less competitive and far worse than real columbia university ccseas
your grandfather s unique headdress  crowdsurftheracoon
this is definitely not true
as an alum having the unique um distinction  of having been a graduate of cc and gs i have to take issue with your comment  cc might be harder to get into and more  prestigious  but in the real world that means absolutely nothing  some of the smartest people i ve met in my career have gone to schools i ve never heard of  employers might care 12 years out of college but after that it s more about what you ve accomplished than the name of the school on your diploma
seeing as we have the better gpas and less money in scholarships grants
bwog is back baby
employers do nt much distinguish between ccgsbarnard on the other hand
i do nt have columbia printed on my resume anywhere and my current employer keeps referring to me as a  columbiaivy league graduate   it does nt give me any particular satisfaction because i think of myself as a barnard grad first and a member of the cu peripheral community second

cuba
it s pantone 292

if you read this it is quite apparent that this policy is bs
but i m pretty sure it s far from  99  of guys who are innocent   more like
i happen to have a friend who was falsely accused because of this bs process  so be high and mighty all you want but shouldnt your ultimate latina lesbian check yo privilege feminist fantasy be protecting the innocent
it s very possible your friend was innocent and guilty at the same time  our culture of sexual machoness pushes men to be  good in bed
seeing as men are the only ones capable under these definitions of committing sexual assault
replying to anonymous below  the reply button is cut off  men are nt the only ones capable of committing sexual assault  but our current sexual climate says it s sexy for men to be the forceful alpha
responding to  we need more consent education   did you read what you just wrote   i can guarantee you if they were ever brought to trial they would legitimately believe they were innocent   now
responding to  peoplism not feminism  drunk sex is nt rape
the national survey of rape conducted by koss et al  revealed that 1 in 12 college men committed acts that met the legal definition of rape
your friend was probably drunk and made a bad decision to sleep with someone he should nt have  also he obviously would nt have gotten convicted if he did nt give off such rapey vibes  tell your friend to stop drinking and dressing like a rapist
hey pretty lady
actually
dat umlaut doe
it s so ironic that feminists try to revoke civil liberties by invoking the title ix clause  especially when they ask to refuse the equal treatment of due process to male s for the sole benefit of women  i m actually quite happy with how the administration has responded to the blatantly sexist policy  now
from page 5 of  columbia university s genderbased misconduct policy for students    for purposes of illustration
no red tape  the largest supplier of red tape on campus  et al will never be pleased  it is one thing to say  there is always room for improvementprogress
columbia released this policy with zero input from students  no red tape and the coalition on sexual violence have spent the last year coming up with specific demands and policy proposals that were completely ignored by the administration in their new policy  so yes
the irony is that the groups make the technocratic claim that valentini and the other deans should nt get to be the appeals handler because
the members of nrt and casv include a number of survivors who have actually been through columbia s process  moreover
to say that the admins did nt consider those proposals when writing this policy packet is crazy  some of their ideas and sentiments clearly made it into the official rules  they re just making the mistake of equating not getting everything  with being ignored and getting nothing
at least they re doing something  give them some time  anyone in the software industry knows the importance of iterative development and just getting a baseline commit out there  now it s time to work with the students to shape things as necessary
if you look through the archives of spectator
yep
should note that the case found the accused at fault and a dean just voided the penalty
oh lord
is it just me or are tech dudes the worst kinds of mansplainers
all hail the stemlords
no food stamps for you
i meant do nt bite the hand that feeds you
we ll protest and chant and petition no matter what changes are made  that is exactly right  and anything less than the exact things that these red tape infants demand is
do not drop the soap
perhaps in poor taste
remember how three days ago everyone was  rallying around  the activists because they said that bacchanal getting canceled was the exact opposite of what they wanted  now they re saying with even greater fervor that they ve been terribly misled and marginalized and given the opposite of what they wantedcomprehensive and inclusive policy reformand suddenly they re crybabies again  anyone want to call the new york times  no
i hate everything about this conversation
the worst kinds of people are the ones that assume only guys are in tech  given the subject nature of this dialogue
sorry
i guess people assumed you were a tech dude because you said the kind of sycophantic
the  compromise and get somethingstay pure and demand our due  debate is as old as injustice  everyone s a cowardly appeaser to someone
bollinger s new office of sexual violence response has an oddly appealing acronym  svr  that is wholly appropriate for a secretive and terrifying bureaucracy with arbitrary powers of arrest
i did not write the above post
uh
you re both right  the kgb was broken up in 1991 the internal security apparatus was continued by the fsb  the external security and foreign intelligence function was taken over by the svr
columbia is the only ivy or major univeristy to do anything on this issue this summer  no other school has made any progress or statements  thank you columbia
what the  are you joking  are you with bollinger s pr office  do you read the news  harvard
harvard has done absolutely nothing
that s not true  visit the website for the office of sexual assault prevention and response at harvard  you will see they have accomplished a lot more than we have  actual engagement from the campus community  real organization  there s no comparison
i m not going to act that i have a great deal of knowledge regarding this topic but i think it s pretty great that administration is making an effort during a break  as an incoming firstyear i have nt seen firsthand how the campus is affected by this increasing problem but before arriving at school administration has tried to inform my class on the genderbased misconduct policy and has devoted a large amount of time during nsop to brief us on the issue  i understand how many students can still be upset
dude
rape  do nt cry because it s over
just kind of curious  what kind of reforms are the student activists proposing  the columbia edits seem kind of comprehensive and i m not sure what else the student groups want changed
they linked it after the jump in blue
and walls of text confuse meam i correct in reading that the changes still leave in effect the system where a large bureaucracy has hearings and interviews
there was nt even a word in the student groups  response message congratulating the university for implementing a new policy  addressing most of the concerns they had in the first place   there are only tiny parts of their initial demands that are missing in the university s policy
i just wish they did nt call plaintiffs in sexual assault cases or people who claim to have been sexually assaulted survivors   that s the language of prejudgementguysgals should probably look into what they can do legally when they re hit with this sort of accusation  you should nt wait until no red tape gets their way and your record is thrashed on a whim because some putz thought  a preponderance of evidence  was a good enough standard to be found guilty of sexual assault
john doe vs columbia university
in other news
yes
yeah
all i hope is that this policy change will result in the guilty being punished and the innocent being exonerated
it is a very difficult situation as the overwhelming number of the  assault  victims and assailants know each other or have had relationships  also many people redact and change their stories
that s not true  visit the website for the harvard office of sexual assault prevention and response  then compare it to ours  this is just one example
that s not true  visit the website for the office of sexual assault prevention and response at harvard  you will see they have accomplished a lot more than we have  actual engagement from the campus community  real organization  there s no comparison
is the best at many things
bollinger looks ridiculous in that picture tho
meanwhile
yes and we need to do more  columbia is falling behind its peers  that s obvious  our future went west  to berkeley  they got a whif of this oligarch  ran

they spend all summer repairing the lawns  read  tearing them up to the bare dirt and then just rolling out turfy sod  from commencement  how could they have been so stupid  in the past  as to undo all of that work with convocation  the immaculate verdant lawns are part of columbia s  image
how are they a lie  you think that shit happens naturally  they re the truth
praise the sun
i did it
columbia lawns are beautiful  thank you
at least they have convocation  back in my day
if i have to graduate in midtown
oh shut up sws

tsk tsk
why does columbia hire contract security when they have proprietary public safety officers  jim mcshane needs to be fired and a full audit needs to be conducted of public safety s finances  why are students forced to pay exorbitant guard service fees to public safety  where does that money go  alumni
the contractors usually work in offcampus apartment buildings  columbia s agreement with the union that represents the oncampus security guards might limit when and where members can be assigned  it almost certainly limits when and where nonmembers can be assigned
i would love to save money on many things
also
more expensive options are nt necessarily better options  even when they are
columbia is an institution that claims to empower every individual in the community to take control over their own life   where does it claim that

ok
that was student services  but still
i just find it crazy that the deans could lie like this  the event was absolutely approved
yeah half this statement details the  measures  that theyve taken to address sexual assault  but ya know
the only thing that s clear right now is that the administration is trying to figure out the most media friendly explanation for this nonsense  protip  trial and error is nt a good pr strategy
i kinda agree with the deans bachanal is a shit show and reflects poorly on us
putting the  k  in 55k
the musicians should be gracious and not ask for the money from a cancelled concert
that s not how the music business works
this is a statement from the associate vice president
good eye  that s orwellian as hellbut realistically everything gets vetted by hornsby
yes this is all hornsbystone bollinger pr machine
you want to humiliate us with campus sexual assault scandals  bachano for you
funny how this response  does nt mention the review of the spring bacchanal
columbia is in the business of giving away  55k for causes that were  never officially scheduled or approved   dear cu
seriously  the efforts i ve had to go to resolve issues of less than a hundred dollars  if you got  55k it involved prezbo and inverted pentagrams  the sundial is a flat circle
that s just what we students need
this is so true  so he s going to create yet another  500k admin position reporting to him  great  is nt that what he did with athletics when he came to columbia  some good that did   i do support lionsit s not their fault their president is disengaged
i was really looking forwards to the free bagels  for all i care they could cancel it
bacchanal s budget is about  100
can i get columbia to open a position for executive vice president of nightlife
why not try  chief digital strategist   close enough   ca nt make this stuff up  that iswas a real position
that was  chief digital officer   sree  he went to the met  smart move
and i m already so over this school
if you are  so over this school  please leave  you are the pessimist individual that constantly complain and do nothing to foster community  it s a shame  i am proud to attend columbia university and although this incident stinks
one does not simply start a new trend  also
i want to rape you peaches
well sucks for you cause you could taste my enthusiastic consent
momo
you ve exceeded your word limit  now write over
if you attended penn  or harvard
i plan on donating millions to columbia because i really have grown as a person   shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
then transfer if you are so unhappy  people dream to get in this school and we are complaining about a concert  i do nt know about you but i spend my 70k tuition on my academics which is my focus so i can better myself
go back to butler 502
you do nt pay
part of your tuition goes to  student life  feesetc
honestly
god this school is miserable  absolutely no school spirit or community  makes me question why i even came here to begin with
i already miss the good ol  days  as a prefrosh
i like how prezbo puts this on the deans  this has bollinger cabal written all over it  which of his senior admin cronies wrote the statement  1  ers all of them  blaming the deans  give me a break
i stand corrected  student and administrative services  rip
fuck it  let s cancel nsop too  probably would make sense according to administration s logic
it s not about a concert  it s about the university s misguided work in the area of rape prevention that implies the best way to keep students safe is to keep them at home  those of you who think it s inappropriate to criticize your university should ask for your money back bc you clearly have nt been taught much analytic ability in your time here
i ll be sure to keep this in mind when columbia giving day rolls around
remember this
remember this
yes well in bollinger s cracker jack administration this is how they handle student  and faculty  concerns  easiest course of action  shut it down  provost troy s spouse susan g gets involved  muddies the process
so boring
could you at least complete our state school aspiration blueballs and tell us who we re missing

cu cancelled bacchanal as a retaliatory measure to make us hate the feminists  as if we did nt already   that way
ixix
no no no
get the councils  students together for a protest on low plaza during nsop and invite ny timesny postlocal press  have people tell reporters that instead of actually addressing the underlying concerns of sexual violence
i m all up for getting organized and pissed off but i sure hope as hell that the times does nt actually think this story fit for coverage  i mean like
an article written already  sexual assault got a lot of national press attention and the attention of a lot of us senators  so perhaps a protest against hypocrisy will get a least a small article written
can you please take a step back and realize what a laughingly privileged thing it is to believe with all your heart that the times should be covering the hemisphereshaking catastrophe of a college concert getting canceled  like

weak joke disclaimer  this just in
the fact that this is being framed as out of concern for sexual assault is so fucking infuriating  none of the activism pushing for sexual violence prevention on campus has had anything to do with bacchanal  it s about disciplinary processes
actually it might be a deluded response to sexual assaults
it s almost retaliatory
this  i m sure they spent time thinking of the response to sexual assault we would most detest as a student body

fuk fuk fuk fuk fuk you    bacchanal is the one time columbia students get to cut loose and act like they go to a normal school  this war on fun has gotten out of control
exactly
hats off to those who wrote this press release  not that the administration is known for responding to reason
everything here is so dramatic
wait hold on that s my money they re just throwing up  seriously fuck you columbia
it s actually not   the admin agreed to cover it so the 55k wo nt come out of student life fees   that said
admin will raise tuition by 55k  number of students next year so it will be paid by us anyway
the deans are paying for it out of their budgets and those budgets are filled with money that students pay  so we re still paying  55 grand for their mistakes  the loss is just being shifted from one bucket to another  that s like 5
where do you get your burritos
ca nt do math  5500 burritos at  10 each is  55
can we take it out of their budgets
stage sitins vs nsop  55k is almost a year s tuition for someone on financial aid  while a party might seem insignificant
please do nt  we had nothing to do with this
fucking hate this school
you find out what the administration did to robin williams
too soon
dear columbia administration  here s a tip  if you want to decrease and discourage sexual assaults from occurring on campus try convicting sexual assault suspects who have strong evidence against them  studies show that when there is a strong punishment enforced people think there could be severe consequences for their crime and thus are less likely to do it  just a thought
except all the studies showing how the death penalty does nothing on crime rates in states with them  oh wait
except those are different crimes
my palm is about to dig itself into my skull
on both sexual assault and the concert issues
or the new york times
newstips  at  nytimescom
does anyone know who the artists for the fall concert were going to be
it unfortunately does not get decided this far in advance usually
read  they confirmed on july 8th
the university pulls shit like this with smaller student groups all the time only now its escalated to an outrageous point  student leaders of student groups spend most of their time working on their groups and this shows that the university has absolutely no respect whatsoever for the work we do  they want to tout it in brochures and on tours
i thought you were going to say  student group leaders spend most of their time working around the administration
working on our clubs is working around the administration
safety concerns over sexual harassment   there is no doubt that s a copout and an affront to all the hardworking advocacy groups on campus  however
students   i m in my mum s car   administration   get out my car   students   aw
they ll be segregating dorms  carmen  menonly
so much cisnormativity
the rest can go to furnald
you dumb
that dumb concert woke me up freshman year when i lived in john jay  good riddance
you sound like you should ve been living in furnald tbh   no disrepect to furnald dwellers
and we fucking wonder why this school has such a shitty yield rate
we have a slightly lower yield rate because the college cross admits with harvard
anyone think that banning grad students from bacchanal is a pretty boneheaded move too
go away
6 grad students were cavad last year while one 1 undergrad was cavad
can you imagine if someone tried to use this excuse to ban an entire group of people from participating in a campus event   half of the behavioral incidents at last year s x were from members of y group
i wonder what group of people you re implicitly referring to  hmm  honestly
wait this is what the bschoolers did but they made a trendy tumblr first
136  1  huh  or is there a third group
they should have to contribute to the fund if they attend the concert
i
now that columbia has killed off greek life
shutting down one event to prevent x number of sexual assaults is not a solution to the problem  sexual offenders do nt need bacchanal to assault someone  they find plenty of other ways to do itwhat pisses me off is there is this subtle implication that sexual violence at columbia is just our own fault because obviously we all just drink too much
yes  everything
what exactly do you think is wrong with preventing x number of sexual assaults
the referenced comment does not say that preventing x number of sexual assaults is wrong  it suggests that while cancelling a campus event may prevent x number of sexual assaults
who exactly are these four undergraduate deans  can someone provide their names and possibly unis here
barnard dean  avis hinkson  ahinkson  barnardeducc dean  james valentini  jjv1  columbiaeduseas dean  mary boyce  boyce  columbiaedugs dean  peter awn  pja3  columbiaedu

overunder on whether prezbo even knows what bacchanal is
fuck this school wow
from the members of nrt and csv who dissented with their organization s statements  is it that they personally do nt like bacchanal
it was only one person  same for each  and apparently they agreed with the deans for  some reason
their reasoning was grounded in serious concern for student safety that were clearly given more thought than anything the admin has provided  however
look closely at who signed from bacchanal  not all of them supported this either
this is comically similar to the plot of this year s varsity show  are we sure this was nt another step in alastair bollinger s campaign to get columbians to bleed blue once more
rats  i was going to sexually assault someone at bacchanal
no seriously  this is a flagrant
hey man
this kind of shit is the reason why students feel like this school doesnt deserve a cent more than we ve already given it
in all seriousness
christ
robin williams
just think  that  55k could ve been rolled into the budget for spring bacchanal and it could ve been even more epic  dammit columbia
do nt worry students
what the actual fuck
look
what     i missed out on arcade fire   aaahhhhh      goodness
ughhh that would have been perfect for the fall especially
obvious fake set list
i really
if they cancel spring bacchanal during my senior year i will seriously throw a brick through a window
sucks for yall  blame the false rape accusers  you brought this upon the columbia community  now the administration is too worried about the false rape victims suing the school
downvote this dood all you want
to be honest
a handful of loud angry women have ruined our school
ca nt we just do bacchanal anyways  like
they literally just did punish thousands of you  see above article
strikes again
concerns about drinking  bacchus was the fucking god of wine
people cheat in class
the decision to cancel highlights the inherent problem or contradiction in the feminist fight against  rape culture   modern feminism has become an ideological justification for a libertine
your comment highlights the reason why the feminist fight must go on  when you say that columbia should cancel an event because it  increases the likelihood that some women will fall victim to assault and rape   you are ignoring the heart of the issue  a women should have the right to act however she sees fit to act at a party  without any fear of being sexually assaulted  period  the party environment itself is not the problem  the problem lies with the people who have no respect for human dignity and think they have a free pass to assault and rape  regardless of whether bacchanal happens
yeah just do walk around drunk in brownsville because you should be able to do whatever you want without fear of repercussions like being robbedraped since it is not okay that bad people exist in this world and it s not incumbent on you to be aware of them or take precautions around them
a women should have the right to act however she sees fit to act at a party  without any fear of being sexually assaulted  period   man or woman
the administration s response makes perfect senseit s a threat   sue us
we have made campus safe  pray we do not make it safer
has anyone considered that maybe the administration is just trying to scare the student body into behaving  maybe this is a great thing  they wo nt actually cancel the spring concert but imagine everyone on campus thinking it s a possibility  who would want their one night of sexual power to cancel an event for the entire student body  i definitely would not want bachannal s cancellation to be my fault  let s see how the campus vibe changes in the fall when everyone is on their best behavior before we really claim the admins do nt understand sexual assault
what about the  55k of student life fees  what about the hundreds of hours the bacchanal committee probably volunteered planning this event
or are you just stupid  or do you really think an undergraduate body of 6000 kids is gon na collectively change their behavior in order to maybe
if anything
oh boo hoo hoo
this  why do people think it is in any way acceptable or appropriate for a university to sponsor an event where alcohol and drugs are abused harder and by more people than usual
i kinda see what the administration is doing here  last year i was on the steps and these girls in front of me were jumping up and down and seeing their boobs jiggle gave me an erection  now due to the close quarters and my above average size my boner was far enough out that when one girl stumbled back she bumped into it and i mean full ass to dick bump too  now im not normally about doin it in the stinky  and my mind was telling me no
can it be that perhaps the administration is doing this as retaliation against the student body for hurting their reputation with the sexual assault lawsuit  this discourages students from reporting university wrongdoing in the future  it s the plan of an evil genius
remember that time the administration wanted to get to the core of campus wide mental health issues    so they then proceeded to place bars on all the windows  i m starting to see a trend
they were concerned that we might hurt ourselves playing sports on campus  so they closed lawns 364 days of the year
spokesperson is lying out of hisher ass on multiple points
fuck bollinger
we ask for more protection and support and you respond by grounding us all because fun  bad
no why   and i missed last year s baccanal  and i was a freshman
good idea  cancel bacchanal  next step is to enforce a dry campus  if there will be rapes after that then they should make it wet again but i m pretty sure it will eliminate 999  of the rapes
interesting destination jordan l  very interesting
jordan lewis is so hot right now
yayback to sleep
sounds like they were bullied
are nt there five people on that poster
ok
on bwog for the first time in over a month and my heart aches and burns why bwog why did i leave
buy your book culture coffee mugs and bags now  by this time next year
i miss the old days when union thugs were union thugs
prezbo would have taken a shit in their mouths
yay  i can go back to book culture
we need unions more than ever  awesome that they won this fight
keep your promises
bangbang
boycotting morton williams should be easy
i miss columbia
fucking gs
based on the description
prof rebay s daughter ilaria was the salutatorian of the college s first coed class
i miss school
poorly written as usual
i have another wordpress troll account  thanks cuit
jared w odessky has failed to live up his campaign promises  cuit could be installing star trek doors in every dorm room  instead he wants to change dumb email  this is because is he part of the grand conspiracy to hide the space technologies from us people who voted for him  as a student of new england descent
another useless survey
this makes people who have no middle initial s last names not apparent is it jsmith  columbiaedu or is it jsmith  columbiaedu  bad design 4 all
would marry 1010
cuit is trying
yes  another amazon prime account  thanks cuit
why do trans students need a different name than the one associated with their official documents  just confused here because i think one of the reasons that aliases were brought up is because initials and numbers are so distant from our legal namesam i just unaware than some trans people change their entire names  i d assume that a first name change is commonplace  the new aliases only include last name
hey
so here at columbia
how is this turning into a trans student issue  i think ramis
i can answer that  i think you re assuming that trans people all choose the same first initial as their given name
there are also a variety of reasons why a trans person might choose to want to keep their given name for legal matters
columbiauniversityschoolofsocialjustice
i do nt even go here anymore
me either
me neither
yo where the food at
friends  i have friends  misery loves company
popping pu   y like it s bubble wrap
vintage boss status ref
why do nt other schools have these collision problems
my guess would be that we get to keep our email addresses forever
exactly this  i ca nt remember where i saw it
what cuit needs to understand is the problem are these long
i think the reason they do nt just let us  have at it   ie
a review process for emails that seem to have nothing to do with their user s first and last name would not be difficult to implement
beyoncebaby  columbiaedu
that has been implemented in some universities would be that we get a choice of usernames
some shitlord literally raped me the other day right on campus  he held my hand when i was drunk  i m going to press charges bc i know this toxic rapeculture loving campus wo nt do anything about it  ugh
am i the only one who preferred unis to this   friendly address  lol
so these are exactly the same as the ones they introduced a couple weeks ago
why cant transgender people just pick new names with the same initials as before  the world shouldnt have to change because one small group wont wavier from their ideology  its like the nazis killing off the non aryans because they believed aryans were a master race  did the whole world change because the nazis wanted them to  no  should we change because the transgenders want us to  no
i get that you think you have a really thoughtful comment but do nt fucking compare anybody to the nazi s  least of all a marginalized portion of society  i m not even particularly sensitive to this shit since i m lucky enough that marginalization of the transgender community really does nt tangibly affect me day to day but what the fuckdo even understand what the nazi s did  these are people that put others in barometric chambers just to watch them die through lack of air pressure which makes your fucking blood boil  they would cut off the arms of twins just to fucking see what happens  there are families that could have lived beside your ancestors that were completely erased  forgotten foreveri understand the point you are trying to make where the minority should not strong arm the majority  i do nt agree but i understand  but fucking educate yourself and understand what you are saying  how impressively thick headed could you be  even as a troll that s insane
i for one object to these new aliases
how is it that cuit is so stupid  why do cc and other schools use them for mail services  here s a solution  use subdomains for each school
anything columbia does takes the path of least effort  i m always surprised when i visit other places  your university cares about you more than about how easy you are to manage  wow
as to how people do nt understand the benefit of it  do nt like it  do nt change your damn uni then  they re not making you do anything
the point is that it could have been better and it was nt
why does bwog censor comments with profanity
because they think we are 2 fucken years old
obamanard
fuck you
where d you guys learn how to write clickbait headlines like this  vice
10 arguments for and against boycotting book culture   4 made me cry
i boycott book culture because of their sky high prices  poorcollegestudent
it s the national labor relations board  nlrb
thanks
nice post  directly written
columbia university school of social justice
how about a story about andrew hamilton  gs 13  passing away  the kid made a big impact on a lot of people and a lot of columbians are reeling right now
because these blogs only write about current students  columbia has thousands of alumni  to read about an alumnus
that s not true  there have been articles about recent graduates and students on leave who have died
i ve cum in countless books at that store
if you do nt like your job
hmm  i do nt think there nearly enough of a basis here to justify the boycotting of this bookstore  from what i can see
as an employee  i agree that this is a legal grey area  what we expected was for the lawyers  nlrb to sort it out while we all continued to work
i feel for the employees
as an academic marxist
you need to get out more
go back to your country you goddamn pinko
unpaid interns would solve this problem immediately
if they did nt like that they could nt unionize
i too am bored enough to comment on bwog during the summer
i remember hearing a story about how it took until the end of august for an electrical engineering class  electromagnetics  to get their grades
yep  i was in that class
no seniors  stupid autocorrect
there was this one materials science class in spring 2012  processing of ceramics and polymers  for which we got the grades after the entire summer  i think it was an ssol upload issue
i m still waiting on one more grade
so timberlake
without alan timberlake there would be only chaos in the world  he gives it it s  somewhat frenetic and occasionally a month and a half late  order
it s much more shameful that america is currently swooning over a dangerous thug who has been involved in sex trafficking in the past and giving him a modeling contract  i will certainly not be buying from any brands that hire him  women can swoon over him all they want
nope
leave timberlake out of this  he is a scholar and a gentleman and can do no wrong
that kind of thinking leads to sexual assaultrape scandals
shut up before i consensually stick my dick in your ass
he was relatively quick for slavic cultures

this is good news for columbia  he is perhaps one of the best presidents in columbia history  columbia is now consistently in the top three or four for admissions
get off your knees
yeah but in appeasing the liberals
adjusts fedora
are you judging someone based on his appearance  you are the paragon of filthy lib hypocrisy
hahahahahahaha
who is this person  which of his cronies wrote this  wake up people  bollinger big ideas  tuition is sky high  fundraising is completely stalled  yet bollinger gets a 20  raise every year  pay attention  look at it  he s leaving in 2018  why would he  with his paycheck and zero accountability  he s not going anywhere  in 2016 he ll extend to 2020 do you think it s an accident he renewed his contract in the summer and not the spring or fall  he does nt want anyone to take notice  look around  get involved  ask the right questions
wake up sheeeple
bschool is down not up  it s not alone
catapulted   columbia went up in some rankings
prezbo was originally set to leave low in 2016   he was never  set to leave  his job  the terms of his contract ran through 2016
i had heard that he planned to leave once the first building in manhattanville opened
i also heard this
we could ask him
guess we do nt matter  need to pay more
it s long past time for progressive and involved leadership at cu  in the fall the senate must take up the issue of term limits for the president  like those for the deanship of the law school
stay forever plzzzz you have elevated our prestige sooo much during your tenure
thank you
yup  fourth highest paid university president in the country   23 million  and it keeps going up and up and up
not if he gets cancer and dies by then  fingers crossed
only private sharing allowed  that s inconvenient
what are the privacy rules
a yesb  so can google and corporations and intelligence agencies
my point is  treat it as a corporate email then
already filled mine up with all kinds of porn
why has nt bwog reported on the spec thing
because bwog is the convicted felon
bwog is not a convicted felon
i love the fact that you replied  thanks for clarifying
exactly what a convicted felon would say
what  spec thing
the lion blog  sorry bwog
privacy is dead
anon is only a little ahead of the times
delete system 23
they better keep that thing up for nsop  welcome to columbia
the one takeaway i got from that is i should aspire to be one of those fat cats
the one takeaway i got from that is that i should aspire to be one of those fat people
mamals construction has to follow all of new york state s labor laws  if they do
are we really protesting that people are willing to work for a certain wage  if these workers felt they were being paid an unfair wage why would nt they be the ones complaining about this  basically we have taken it upon ourselves to protest for people who do nt even want us to be protesting for them
sounds like columbia to me
agreed new york city has some of the highest labor costs and labor protections and salaries in the nation
those damned protections  how dare they  prezbo eats pieces of shit like these workers for breakfast
allow me to dissociate from this particular instance for just a minute  people will protest when they feel that they can afford to lose the job and find another if things go sour  the fact that people are willing to work for a certain wage does nt necessarily mean that they re happy to do it
wow u r a saint
mamais is plenty shady
they have no connection to columbia  they are known fro asbestos abatement
first  tracked  second
for the tracking tip  i wonder who is this fella writing all these procolumbia statements
does it really matter  same type of person that turned the noco wikicu article into a press release
dude it s summertime
unions suck
there s a difference between feeling that you re being treated satisfactorily and being  willing  to do something  all that requires is fearing a worse alternative
thought that insect was just a new face in the administration
the admins are roach people
they are not doing any work at the new campus  they do nt do new construction
could nt they have at least run the protest paper through spellcheck first
get out
i miss the good old days when we protested men on campus instead of big business
people have the right to decide which job to take  if the workers do nt like the company
do you really think that the workers had the opportunity to weigh this job against a smorgasbord of other offerings   desk job with benefits  no thanks
nobody has a right to a job or a right to a wage  those things do nt belong to you  they belong to the person who is hiring you  just because someone does nt have other options does nt mean i have any obligations to them  there are plenty of people who worked hard to get out of homelessness and poverty so that they could have lots of job options  if someone does nt have the skills to get a better job
so denying degrees to jeff bell and lou antonelli so eric holder and barry obama will pimp for your grantgrubbing does nt pay off after all
us needs to stop getting drawn into groups with dirty african nations  this match is a blood bath  no regard for the beautiful game
did nt know germany and portugal were considered dirty african nations
all nations are third world compared to america
those talk mag people are insane
fifa you re all putos
starbucks got a fucking b
no intern fills coffee cups
mcbain going through asbestos abatementyuck
i hope someone gets sick so columbia gets slapped with a mesothelioma suit
but wishing a terminal lung cancer on someone to spite columbia is perhaps a bit much
3rd floor of hamilton is also undergoing asbestos abatement  there s a danger sign and everything
the gates are also missing from the entrance near carman
wth is gulati doing  so this is what professors do over the summer
y he no disclose his compensation for being on exco yet
the 1929 gates all the 114th st gates
and i m pretty sure those gates are coming back
probably taken down for the summer renovations
i hope they put all the gates back
i hope they are putting all the gates back
i hope they add a moat too
pupin
the jerome l greene science center is nearing completion and the lenfest center for the arts is under construction

can someone tell me why i did nt just apply to barnard instead of columbia if all barnard girls claim they just graduated from columbia
because you wanted to actually graduate from columbia
sure
they got all that columbia dude sperm in them that not only are they columbia folks but also men  now you know  bojangles
many take classes at both institutions  or mostly one or the other  i think it depends
if the only reason you applied to columbia is to say you graduated from columbia we do nt want you go away
i bet you and your righteous indignation have sucked solo many dicks
i do nt know anna
i have unending respect for you  this just reinforces that
why did your tooth fall out
irl it s a short story
such an inspiring
omg i have no idea anyone else was even aware of the existence of wuthering heights  great song
anna you are my journaliststudentactivistfashionlevelofwit idol and i wish i had known you better and somehow gleaned more wisdom from you  there are many different spheres on campus that will always be vibrant
anna

congratulations all  this is probably one of the most beautiful commencements in the nation
hammers clearly represent the male anatomy
ca nt tell if this is making fun of barnard or seas
let me guess by that you mean all women are incapable of thinking  well discount our accomplishments all you want we are going to win because gender inequality must end  and you know what else has to end rape  when someone steals your laptop its not an excuse that they thought that the laptop wanted to be stolen  so stop trying to tell us we wanted it  we did nt you just raped us anyway  and do nt go on about how you were drunk that is not an excuse for raping someone  when i get drunk i do nt just go around and commit felonies  you have to have an evil streak to start committing acts of violence just because you are drunk  but i guess its just in vino veritas right  when men get drunk they show their true colors as rapists like all of them are
what about the hammers representing the 4 years of hard work that all engineering students put in to graduate
holy shit  it all goes by so fucking fast  to those who remain  hold fast
i was waiting for this moment ever since freshman year
welcome to the club
hold fast
if interested
good riddance  14 sucks  i m the king of this school now btches

the 14 stat is complete garbage  even 15 is pushing italso would it kill some of the ladies in the video to wear a bra  sorry not sorry  k thx  bai
you made me focus on boobs the whole video  not sorry either  did nt see anyone  noticeably  without a bra though

1 would love to see some legitimate proof as to why you think the statistic is  complete garbage  2  our bodies
you go girl  this is exactly why i need feminism  before feminism i was just another fat girl with a lousy iq  and now
your body
sure  instead lets have 20ish year old menchildren spend the tens of thousands of dollars it takes to raise a kid rather than the  40 for emergency contraception used for instances of both consentual and nonconsentual intercourse  you are truly inspiringif you ever find two brain cells to rub together
lol that s cute
the only reason these attention whores keep making these dumbass patontheback videos is because you are calling them  so brave  and rewarding them for shitting on other people  from a wrongly accused
wrongly accused survivor
fuck off
50  of college women who were victims of rape did not consider what happened to them rape  what
rape  the act
did you just say a brush on the shoulder on the hallway is rape  yes
although upon reading this again i feel you may have been trolling since lgbtqrnagzyf is nt anywhere on google
you were nt coercedforced to have sex  from the sounds of it
lol
between the mermaid stripper
holy shit
although i can hardly say i disagree with you
i do nt like the not asking for it videoabsolutely none of their stats are being given context  the audience is being talked at and is being given very little to work with in order to think about the issue at hand

glad these comments show a certain ambivalence about raph
this is exactly correct  she is also one of those people that will meet you
glad to have met you
raph is an excellent person and she s much more approachable than you might think  so throw away that frenchsnob prejudice and ask her on a coffee date  or even better  a 1
raph
raph like a week ago and she treats me like an old friend  she s awesome
you are amazing and intimidating and everything i want to be by the time i m a senior   3

he is that cute indian guy
you forgot to mention your engagement to our dear tanvi  the inlaws are not going to appreciate the fact that you completely left his out of your wisdom

his words of wisdom are to not try hard in classes  wtf hahaha  never met him

tldr like
love you
i think we all can make just enough time to read the sincere and inspirational thoughts of someone who has spent four years giving herself to this school and the people here
not that much time
wait
nope  she graduated high school in 2010  source  she had aimed to graduate early from high school andor college
or she loves the people in the earlier classes
love you rakhi  the world needs more people like you  thank you
rakhi
rakhi
rakhi is a gem of a human being  this whole community is truly better for the love and dedication she has poured into us
rakhi gave me a rose on my graduation  that s how i will always remember her
rakhi spent her entire college career devoting a crazy amount of time to helping people on projects big and small  as well as being there to assist you in every possible crisis  time it takes to read this is fractional to the time rakhi spends doing things for others
so impolite  she put so much time into this and tried to give honest advice  not to mention good advice
oh heeellllll no
dislike it all you want  i m a feminist and this story only proves that all men are rapists
well yeah
you do nt understand how rape affects all women  we are all survivors because we all know someone who is a survivor  sometimes im afraid to go out on the street around campus
urabitch
you do nt understand how false accusations affects all men  we are all victims because we all know someone who is a victim  of false accusations   sometimes im afraid to go out on the street around campus
how   how does it do that
you are so ignorant take a women s studies course and you ll understand  we deserve some fucking respect
but you probably do nt care about what i say because i m a woman so in your mind i do nt have rights
hit the nail on the head right there did nt you haaaaahahhaheeeehhoooohhahahhahaha ha ha ho he ha
i do nt care what you say because you re abrasive and whiny  it has nothing to do with your penis envy
bc 15 is a troll
she s not a troll  just a bit overzealous  what s worse though is that you try to silence such a courageous girl  you do nt get to decide who is a rapist and who is not a rapist  maybe she s been so traumatized that she sees all men as rapists  i for one do nt think that s so far from the truth  yesterday
and before you haters attack my comment for the suffrage bit
your moms a troll  i did her anyway tho
she s misguided  i think she truly believes what she s saying  and that s exactly the problem  in overcorrecting
as a nrt board member i would like to make a factual clarification  the beliefs espoused by bc 15 and a few others in the comments do not represent what we stand for  just so you do nt mistake this dungeon troll for us i have prepared a handy list below of things we do stand for1  rape is the single greatest threat to learning  when you are in an environment that is riddled with rapists you are depriving a significant body of the students from the education they are entitled to2  rape is preventable  men are able to make a decision not to rape  it is wholly within their abilities to take time and reflect upon their decisions3  rape must be punished  if rape is not punished you do nt get any deterrence  as ordinary legal channels are timeintensive and do not convey the immediate message of disapproval universities nationwide need to swiftly punish rapists  this way men will see the negative consequences of their decisions4  rape must be prevented  if you have sensitivity training then men can be made to understand where they err in their decision making processes  we have already made ten costeffective proposals to administration involving gender reversal situational awareness programming  the only method that has proven effective   each one has been rejected without any explanation  if men are made to understand what the experience of rape is like then they tend not to reinforce cycles of victimization5  there is no middle ground on rape  either you wear the red tape or you support rapethank you for your time and please behave responsibly and do what you can for all the survivors on campus they need your support  they need it a lot more than some who resort to hiring expensive lawyers and slandering the institution whose only mistake was offering admission to a rapist
what sandra said is true  we d also like to thank everyone s support for our cause  because of your help
5  there is no middle ground on rape  either you wear the red tape or you support rape   george bush much  i do nt like the idea of wearing anything over my graduation gown  guess i ll have to support rape then  too bad
gay and trans individuals and people of color need not partake   why
this entire comment section is obviously like 90  trolling
so are you for rape  nothing the board members of nrt espoused is extreme unless you are a rape apologist  if you are among the lower echelons of nrt membership i suppose your ignorance is forgivable but i want to make sure that people do nt actually mistake your heresy for some statement that anything sandra said is contrary to the message of nrt  seriously
sister you must not have been at the nrt meeting long enough to have been assigned a mentor or  big sister  as they are called  this is terribly distressing as you have been misled by the forces of the patriarchy into believing dogma  worse still you misrepresent nrt  we stand for everything that sandra our beloved board member has articulated  read the five truths again and try to internalize the message for it is important that you understand the true path
and this is why you go to barnard  byefelicia
i knew a woman who claimed that most
track this crazy s comments ppl  love
get a fucking life  all men are rapists  you re giving impression that columbia is a place where smart men
i heard that this boy or maybe it was another put his thing between her buttcheeks  i will have you know that as a gay man that sort of thing is becoming way too mainstream among yall  i mean i thought that this school was liberal and against appropriation and stuffs like that  well every time you put it in a girl s butt you are depriving gay men of their culture  if that is what you want to do then there is a place to do it and it is not in a woman  now i do nt do that inside a man because that is not my disposition
i think my professor put it best when she told me after class  you can feel a rape
what people are failing to account for is the disproportionate violence that is unleashed upon transgendered women at columbia  far be it for me to out someone but as a mtf transgendered woman of color i can tell you that there are many women who have gone through the bloodshed to gain their womanhood here  the men of columbia disproportionately inflict sexual violence upon us to deal with their confused sexual identities  i just wish we could start a dialogue that did nt immediately get down to what is between your legs  no
okay
hell no is right  this dude only get a 95  score on the sat  that s shit  i got a 9999 percentile score and got rejected by three ivies  fuck the system
let me tell you a story  a white heteronormative cisgendered ceo professor and baptist preacher was teaching a class on karl rove
like this if u cry every time
honestly speaking
if you read the suit
i can tell you what his name is  any white cisgendered heterosexual man  yall need to consider the damage your whiteness does anywhere it goes  and do nt give me that  boohoo  i m an ally
your stupidity is raping my brain
i have rape fantasies all the time  the problem with rape is that the people that are raped are not allways the ones who want to be raped  i do think rape is kind of hot though
starts munching popcorn
its people like you who prove that the only good men are gay men  i have lots of gay friends and around them i feel safe  all straight men are creeps  and no i m not a lesbian
it seems to me that two new narratives are emerging   1  because rape  in whatever form  is so horrifying and so terrible
in response to  1
you may very well be telling the truth  no red tape believes that even if you are
no red tape is the only reason why my friends and i go out at night   all of my friends have been assaulted at least 3 or 4 times during their years at columbia
dear sarah
did you and all of your friends get assaulted 34 times  that s fucking insane  i do nt wan na put the blame on you
can confirm  am one of her assaulters  i accidentally shook her hand when we first met  did nt realize the university considered that non consensual touching until it was too late
no red tape does not believe anything like that  stop telling everybody lies about what you think we stand forwe stand for peace and justice for everyone
i feel for you
there is no such thing as a  false accusation   the guy is always responsible for what happens  it does not matter if the girl is drunk rape is rape
the guy is always responsible  sounds fair
the guy is always responsible for what happens   excuse me
do us all a favor when you get home and drink a gallon of bleach
track button does wondersgo back to your dungeon
hi sarah
are sarah and john doe  2 the same person  tracking is so useful
i am the same person as the above  and i sincerely apologize to john  tracking is less useful when you do nt totally understand how to use it  they are not the same person
you are so retarded   we are not the same person
maybe if you stopped raping women like all he other men of this thread you d understand that your ignorance and privilage make you like so stupid
do yourself a favor and track this comment  this person has been trolling the entire comment section
hes also been trolling your mom in bed
damn these female students accusing males of rape when they didnt  it s horrible that the university is so harsh while punishing accusations of rape even if there is not enough evidence   moreredtape
omfg this is just ridiculous  the extent to which lawyers twist things amazes me
fact  according to ny state laws  anal sex is not considered rape  look it up    now lets get crazy
lol
so a rapist was punished with a mere temporary suspension before being released back among the unwary student body
so the guy is arguing this is consensual
this is nt even the only case of misjudgment and false accusations
i hope this young man s courage inspires others to do the same  his lawyer summarizes the issue pretty damn well when he says  i think theres been an overcorrection to what clearly has been a problem
is the daily princetonian so involved in this
probably realized the spec was too shoddy to present his story properly
can we just agree
no  they were smart and brave enough to pick this story up  it was only after princeton s courageous decision that bwog published the article
shots fired at anna bahr
not really though  they re just using her reporting as evidence of columbia s incompetence
like
kony2012
boys cry wolf girls cry rape
why both john doe and jane doe remain anonymous and all these other students  named in the complaint are completely non anonymous
if you read the actual complaint
it s amazing what can be found on the internet  even that his parents  house has a market value of  2 million
your mom has a market value of  2 tho
not even close  i just fact checked you and his home has an estimated worth of  210k
and i m pretty fucking proud of myself
who is john galt
omg atlas shrugged reference  we are soul mates
no such thing as soul mates  only rape mates  feel free to sign my petition on changeorg to change the word  love  to  rape
jilleian sessionsstackhouse needs to be evaluated in the way she goes about her job  like interviews without being recorded  really
affirmative action hires should nt be placed in positions of such importance
she ca nt even say the word  ask  properly  lmfao
the heart of the complaint is that the sex was consensual
let me guess bc 15
i do work in finance but thats none of your business  just because i work in finance does not mean i deserve to be raped
i bet you even tried anal back in the day with your high school boyfriend  i bet you tried to tell him he raped you even though you told him he could do it just because it hurt more than you expected
i did and it hurt so much i refused to talk to the guy for months  it took him like 2 whole seconds to pull it out  do you understand that is not consensual
if men payed any attention to the real rape statistics there would not be rape  78  of women will be raped at some points in their lives  its a fact  that is 4 out of 5 women  this is scary
do nt you think at least some of the 78  were asking for it
that s utterly crap  there are more male rapes than female rapes in the us  prison rape is a thing  unless you define that as illegitimate rape  how ironic
what is wrong with you  its attitudes like that that makes us women agree there is no need for a trial  they should all be thrown in jail to protect the survivors  false accusations are a myth
it s attitudes like that that make us sane
there s no reason to throw brown people in jail on september 12th  muslims on the other hand
what a stupid name for a newspaper
favorite this bwog
mkayy
hold up  are you tone policing a woman of color  bc 15 is a proud woman of color and she does not need to be told how to speak by some white girl with a rapist brother  your brother raped me do nt you understand that
john doe worked diligently in high school
ms kao  the ra  informed john doe that she wanted to discuss the evening of may 12 with john doe and was advised that john doe and jane doe engaged in consensual sexual intercourse on may 12
also
the report keeps mentioning all of these  witnesses  who would have provided so much insight to the alleged assault
based on the foregoing
it s a  10  acceptance rate for rich white men  check your privilege  look at affirmative action and how that changes acceptance rates
track button does wonders  half this thread is bc 15 responding to herself
your moms asshole does wonders
so what happens if i feel conflicted about reporting a rape  i could swear it was an accident  and even if it is  rape
when you re on bottom
woops meant to be a response to  hey do you like anal
i am so confused by this comment thread
between a feminist and a sumo wrestler
sumo wrestlers shave their legs
sumo wrestlers shave their legs
this proves that women lie and can just say anything  with just the woman s word
this is why i avoid women and only jerk off to dating simulations  the fleshlight made pussy obsolete  i really wo nt understand why one would risk emotional and legal damage and open up to another human being  i rather play minecraft then go on a date  i really fear a false accusation  i look weird and the way i look would cause the deans who run the judicial process to prejudge me  in a way
to a woman with no arms and no legs
nice tatas
feminist with no arms and no legs

a school i would never send my daughters to

i am a real proud woman of color and i believe dat womyn need some of dat respect if yall no wut i m sayin  i worked hard  i went to yall colleges and what do i get for dat   huh  ya ll men need to take the chill pill cauze when you roll wit real gurlz like me i ll show you whats up  i like my men wit sum muscle cuz when you got that vtaper all the girls wan na rape ya  so go get a thick ass back and you ll have em hoes in da sack
yo i read what dat other bitch above me said and i am offended  first of all obamacare is way better than rape
i am a foreign exchange student and in my country these things are not spoken of or at least i do nt think they are as it seems many of the concepts are not translatable  are the girls complaining that the men did not marry them or did not buy them gifts  what is the complaint if someone could explain it simply and perhaps with specific details of what is occurring instead of through vague concepts that i do nt understand
is rape legal if the girl does not speak english   like no means no  but what if you dont know what no means
its legal
create lesbians
so feminists would nt breed

i ve never seen trolling like bc 15  a master at work
wrongful outcomes are not exclusive to improper dismissals  both are symptomatic of a mock judicial process that is a sham for all parties involved  i fear that this  no middle ground  debate obscures the problem that is most immediately redressable  columbia s system for dealing with allegations of sexual assault is woefully inadequate for both victims and the accused  i am a 2013 graduate of columbia university and a female who considers herself to be a feminist  as a teenager i was a victim of improper sexual  joke   at columbia i was the victim of a false accusation  when i was fourteen years old
john doe  a wasp name if i ve ever heard one  probably cisgender too
john doe s identity can be found in 2 minutes using white pages s reverse address lookup using john doe s address provided in the suit
there is a way to see updates on the case when it gets to court
it is because of rapists like you that i ca nt go to 1020 anymore  last time i was there this guy said to me i looked sexy  i m so damn tired of being objectified  it is not okay to say that shit about women how can you not understand that
and besides  unless you are gay  which is totally okay by the way  if you practice anal sex then you have some twisted hatred against women  we are not meant to be fucked in the ass
hey troll
tim
actually bc 15  is trolling trying to pretend like bc 15 is some sort of troll  i have seen this sort of reversetrolling before  nobody should trust it at all  we have seen the comments by bc15 and it is obvious that she is genuinely delusional
troll nasrsly
reply to  actually bc 15   you are idiots  no one needs to make you look like anything
anon below me is a retard
not this time
you are idiots  fratharder

seriously
why would a man with an endless line of female suiters choose a young

you
a quick google search reveals that her name is  ricki lander  not  ricki landers   thanks for getting the story right every single time
this article is extremely disrespectful to a huge columbia alum
i do nt think hgaf  see  he took her to a hillel event
giving money to columbia  never having to deal with scrutiny from students  not that this is really scrutiny  it s pretty clear what he s doing and why  but it s no secret theyre dating
this is while i ll never donate if i am rich someday  students will take your money because you  owe it to them  and then mock you all the while sneering at the lateness of your payment  people only have respect for those who do nothing for them
the largest distributor of red tape on campus
yo where can i cop some green tape
any girls dtf after the commencement ceremony
red tape  dtf  is this a thing now
that is correct
i think instead of bothering the administration with red tape we should red rum them
ruff ruff ruff    ruff   ruf

i do nt disagree with their overall message
then do nt put red tape on your cap
i m conflicted  i support nrt but i do nt want to look like i  stand for  rape   lest i wear red tape during the hardearned graduation i picturedgs did something similar two years back where a number of people wrote their student debt  a violent act in its own right  on their mortar boards
i m not doing it  but that s the idea  you either wear it or are for rape
where in the statement does it say  if you do nt wear it
to the anon asking where in the statement   by placing a piece of red tape on your cap  ideally parallel to the right side
lol first of all
this is dumb
factual clarification  this is not specifically coming from nrt as a group  red tape has been a symbol of antirape culture college groups for like 2 decades
this is directed at commenters
if you support rape where green tape on your hat
i just want to reiterate
no one gives a fucck
what happened at barnard today
these individuals contacted no red tape columbia on saturday to coordinate efforts
why u no include seas in this discussion  not a single meche i ve talked to have gotten this email
they re trying to do class day by class day
gaaaaaayyyyy
it seems to me that two new narratives are emerging   1  because rape  in whatever form  is so horrifying and so terrible
i d always told myself that bwog commenters were not at all representative of the student body
get this email  are they like  sending them selectively
as a member of nrt i just want to inform you guys that newsletters have been sent to the parents of all men who have been privately accused of engaging in sexual misconduct  we feel that many of the men who have availed themselves of the privilege of raping the young women at this great institution should explain their conduct to their mother  sure you can shut out our voices but when your own mother tells you that you are a rapist maybe you ll finally listen

some

you sent a newsletter to the parents  really
personally
are you serious
the disadvantaged people in the us are poor people not black and hispanic people  the overwhelming majority of poor people in the us are white  taking rich black kids from andover and exetor as harvard and other schools are now doing does not create diversity  are the obama girls  disadvantaged minorities
i think you should consider the fact that by percentage
affirmative action  i am tired of this politically correct society lowering our standards because some lazy people do nt want to put into the work
instead of sitting around writing opeds on brown v board

about time senior wisdom featured a barnardian  bwog
ooo look at all the zionists down voting these comments  pathetic
yes
this girl seems like a total radical kunt
it s president spar
thank you for telling us  the staffer responsible has been fired  all inquiries should be sent to jake  bwogcom
well
calm down
she s a dean within the university bureaucracy
is it that we can be kicked out of school for academic dishonesty but rapists found  responsible  by the university are allowed to remain on campus  i m genuinely curious
because the university s standard is nt innocent until proven guilty  if the person takes the case to court and proves that the proceedings were a mummer s farce and that there was nt enough evidence to convict her
that does nt answer the question at all
mummers farce   quit stealing my material
maybe because academic institutions are better at handling academic issues than criminal issues
does anyone know about the conspiracy theory that little people are controlling the us government
rape culture engages in crude stereotyping that relies upon buzzwords
anonymous  your facts are wrong  rapists and rape apologists love to cite this information
the above comment cites erroneous facts about rape  one out of four or five women are raped in their lifetimes and few men are held accountable  false rape claims are rare
how could this possibly go wrong
are they sharing one shot glass
how did they have time for this
i can put my whole fist in my mouth

so proud of you emma
first time  let s have sex  oksecond time  let s have sex  okthird time  let s have sex  can we do anal  ok  20 min later  anal hurts so nvm you rape
we were dating and when he would have sex with me he would be rough and sometimes i would cry  only months later when we ended it
stop lying  as proof of the fact that you are lying
too late  damage is done  people wo nt return to this post
i should press charges for every bruise i got on my dick because of girls who use their fucking teeth  the bitemarks prove it was violent and nonconsensual
track these anon comments
emma telling your story is brave and courageous  a little part of me though feels bad for the guy
i heard he is suing emma for defamation of character for acting as an accomplice to the vandals  it s ironic but i think he has a strong case against her since he has more evidence than she does
sadly
the above is incorrect  while an accusation of a crime would indeed be considered per se defamatory
wrong again  burden of proof is only on those accusing public individuals  both defendants are legally considered private citizens
why is the name not in the uni database  a picture of the attacker would also be helpful
people can make their uni not appear in directory
his name in the uni database is paul nungesser  he goes by jeanpaul ezhno on fb
this dude s facebook says he  studied at korova milk bar   you would think that someone being investigated for rape would have the sense not to make weird clockwork orange references in public
it s time for mr nungesser to tell his side of the story  he has nothing to lose at this point
he has nothing to gain and everything to lose  not a chance he says anything
the way to the right
that the  serial rapist  is not some athlete  frat boy  inebriate
he was on the crew team freshman year
he should probably shave that mustache before court  just saying
this does not feel like justice
she was raped  what is so hard to understand about that
she alleges that she was rapedi m not saying the guy was innocent  but nor should he be presumed guilty just because she said so  we do nt know the facts here  there have been cases of vengeful exgirlfriends making false rape accusations  i m sure you can think of more
why would  vengeful exgirlfriends  be the more probable case  i just do nt understand why people would believe that someone is less likely a victim of abuse and more a vindictive hysteric who would go through all this trouble
where did he say it was more probable
let s be serious
actually
there are also cases where human beings bite dogs
seriously   seriously   what is so hard to understand about the need to prove allegations  someone claiming heshe was raped does not itself constitute rape  calm the f down
calling someone a rapist when they rape someone is not defamation
hate to do this  but prove itcivil cases use preponderance of evidence too  he has a good case  no evidence
i hate agree with you
does no one understand the sheer bravery this girl is showing by coming forward with her story at all   some victims are so horrified and ashamed of what happened to them that they do nt say anything  she came forward and filed a report not only with columbia
they were nt saying she was nt brave or that he was innocent  only that
how do you know  is any acquittal only ever evidence of a broken system in your view  anything less than a 100  conviction rate is simply justice denied to those accusers who did nt win their cases
his images can be obtained on youtube where he was interviewed making a movie

great
for dad films
no wonder this guy is a rapist  he should ve joined for mom films or for parents films
she was raped  what is so hard to understand about that
this is in response to anons above  this does not feel like justice  post
it s that logic that led to witch hunts and lynchings  she may very well have been raped
the problem with all this is that rape is ultimately a crime with very
cripes
this is the last i ll comment on this issue
muttering okay is nt consent  consent is an enthusiastic yes
so many men are nervous about this type of shit  so a person you ve been having sex with approves of a sex act
why would you have sex without someone who was nt completely into it tho   if the other person is bored is nt that a turn off  or mean that you should reexamine how you re doing things
most retarded thing i read all day  and ive been on barstool twice
it is nt the same as rape
that s an awfully slippery standard  let s be clear
she has no valid proof  she wants someone to be kicked out of school on her word  even though she has had consensual sex with him twice before  and even though it has been a year since the alleged act  i m sorry but she is not self aware at all  she does nt realize that she comes off as if she does nt know what the hell she is talking aboutbut mostly i m sorry that as a woman
is wrong with you
you should serve in the gender based misconduct panel lol
as a woman you feel bad you ca nt support her  as a human being on this planet
as a human being living in a liberal society with the rule of law
the same misogynistichomophobic logic behind those crimes in other parts of the world foster the rapeculturegender imbalance that allows for these types of crimes to continue to go unnoticed here  there are two completely different sets of intentions and histories driving both  when the law refuses to take care of its citizens such as in most of these cases of sexual assaultrape
how would you suggest she go about it  she went to her school and she went to the police  what the fuck else are you supposed to do  if you mean be quiet and submissive about it
go to the police immediately
why do nt you say  fuck  a few more times  i think that should convince me
i m sorry
does anything give you license to anally rape someone  i do nt know why you qualified that statementalso i ve noticed a lot of heteronormativity in the comments  like the only people who get anally raped are women  excuse me
serial rapist
cereal rapist
wrong  there is only one allegation of rape  the other two allegations concern a woman claiming that he grabbed her and attempted to kiss her
define rape
making women even more crazy  you re right
stfu all of you talking about  ahh prove it   ahhh preponderance   ahhh no evidence   ahhh she is doing this wrong   none of that is really relevant  if she was attacked
bingo  thank you  she s not asking the fucking readers of bwog to serve justice in this case
who is arguing with her right to take legal action  those who should  stfu  about evidence are the ones favoring the intrinsically legal  component of that action  those who condemn a potentially innocent man  regardless of the evidence
why do nt you guys say  fuck  a few more times  very convincing
i do nt understand why this was nt done sooner  sexual assault is a crime  crimes are handled by the nypd  by federal mandate any investigations into sexual assaults on campus merely find a person  responsiblenot responsible  based on a  preponderance of evidence   that s not the legal standards that courts go by
from the spec article   during that time
unfortunately there is no alternative to the police  the nypd is nt burger king
thank you
but the whole  y no nypd    thing implies that she has failed to fulfill her duties as a rape victim  it does nt take into account the shock and fear victims experience in that critical window after their attack
shock and fear does nt excuse a complainant from showing proof beyond a reasonable doubt  i understand what you re saying
should the police be actively dismissing her story

because she s fishing for attention  jesus titty fucking christ
because we believe in innocence until proven guilty  why should i believe either of them  i do nt know either of them
unfortunately
please explain how you even go about proving rape   like say this is true
therefore an allegation should constitute evidence  are you that dumb  the difficulty of finding evidence does not obviate the need for evidence
be a fucking idiot
since when did i say the victim s word constitutes evidence  stop adding words to my statement  i m actually saying the opposite  i do nt see how my question was stupid  i did search how the procedures are for rape cases and it still does nt make sense  if it was consensual sex and they used a condom   the vaginal swab will prove nothing
this is why columbia is full of judgmental pretentious assholes  i m asking a question and my response is that im stupid  great thanks for letting me know we ca nt have a discussionargument in a mature manner
a rape kit performed by doctors establishes that sexual contact took place  medical professionals document any signs of injury including signs that force was used to restrain a victim  toxicology tests can determine how intoxicated a person was
this is why i only have sex with myself because my hand cant rape me
clearly people who hate the police in instances like this have never seen l and o  svu
do you know what it means to ruin a life  completely destroy a person  excrete them from society  inflict lifelong humiliation  my father was accused 50 years ago  never a trial or conviction  i was called rapey boy  my sisters were called rape sluts  i had to leave home at 18 when the woman who accused my father died  her son found her diary  she wrote about how she lied because she really liked him
exactly what it means to ruin a life
liar    you are not a man  i know you  you re just a stupid girl who thinks she knows it all
i m not complicit in any  system  because i did nt make it or design it  i refuse to take the blame for someone else  would you recommend executing someone simply because he shares the same skin color as a convicted killer  why should i take the fall for someone else simply because he is of my sex  i m not a rapist
ever stop to think that it might be justified in blaming someone for not reporting a crime  everyone here is touting their trumpets  this man is a serial rapist  and do nt even stop to think
three women reported him and he was confronted by a governing authority  yet he still was audacious enough to do it again
this case has gotten way too much attention  the more i read
rape is not sex
of course rape is sex  just because you think it s bad does nt mean it is nt sex
rape
is bwog still a journalistic publication
so what did bwog do wrong by reporting on this
get money fuck bitches
jeanpaul
jeanpaul
please stop publishing names of accusers or victims bwog  destroying his reputation befote he is judged guilty or innocent is unnecessary  furthermore no one knows who is right and who is wrong  let us wait for a verdict
jeanpaul has not been convicted in any court and he was found to be not responsible by columbia  so you should take responsibility for libeling him
i am so over this story  it got way out of hand  i do nt want to read anymore about it
i do nt think that commenter was saying that allegations should be blindly believed  just that we should recognize that it s not so easy to provide proof in this situation
better call saul
yo we should all just not give the girls the d anymore for a bit and then they ll be raping us problem solved  bojangles
emma sulkowicz raped me 2 years ago  i did nt report it to police because i was ashamed
heterosexual anal sex was often practiced in order to prevent pregnancy in peru  does anyone know if we have a study abroad program in lima  i have a feeling the women there are more accommodating
enough  just stop  christ  not a single word in this article warrants your misguided attempt at a joke
what the fuck is wrong with you
it rubs the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again
the track button does wonders
these kids are so pretentious
have they told us yet about latin honors
fuck the earth
putting aside the economic inefficiency that such divestment plans would enact  students should nt have the right to determine where the school invests its endowment  it seems logical to me that donors and those who donors trust to manage the school s endowment should make that determination  the school s endowment is not the property of its students  we are lucky to have been allowed the many benefits of columbia s endowment and no matter how much or how little money columbia invests in exxon or chevron
if i remember correctly
so instead of doing nothing except sending a message
we need policy to actually boost research and implement solutions
clearly you do nt understand that a depletion allowance is not a  subsidy  and solar companies and solar infrastructure are subject to actual subsidies and still they can not compare on a cost basis to natural gas in most parts of the us
for laymen  truth is that the oil and gas industry receives the same kinds of tax treatments that every other manufacturing or extractive industry receives in the federal tax code  there is nothing uncommon or out of the mainstream of tax treatments about any of the provisions that have been repeatedly proposed for repealso how did all of this misinformation get started  it all began in 2009 within days of being sworn in as the nations 44th president
for you to say that a depletion allowance  which is essentially a tax writeoff  is not a subsidy is laughable  fossil fuel companies have been able to reduce their costs significantly by being able to deduct some of their income and manufacturing
you show your ignorance by claiming that its an uneven playing field
a you fail to take into consideration the other indirect subsidies that are given to the industry
a  show me some of the  vast literature  there is a piece of literature proving my point above yet i do nt see any piece of literature on your partb  do you ignore the words  solyndra being an obvious example   the aggressive tone you take squares with the pretty obvious reality that the movement is misguided  i am not trying to give you a lesson in economics
a here s a frequently cited study about fossil fuel subsidies that has become big in the financial world
i do nt support divestment  i do nt support environmentalism because it s closely linked to eugenics  as is the progressive movement in general  john maynard keynes was the director of the british eugenics society
this is the most ridiculous thing i ve ever heard
this entire debate  reinforces the words of michael bloomberg
love boat
my best friend
by your estimations
are you just looking around the internet looking for relevant places to copypaste your powder room article  also
i feel like i m the only person on campus who has nt seen the list
is it that we can be kicked out of school for academic dishonesty but rapists found  responsible  by the university are allowed to remain on campus  i m genuinely curious
good point
parties
clearly barnard
because columbia university is not a legitimate judicial authority  administrative actions
columbia has rape tourette s
the disenfranchisement of half our student population is upon usrape culture engages in crude stereotyping that relies upon buzzwords
can we please stop throwing around the term rape culture   saying that it s a culture makes it seem like that rape is almost like an organized and acceptable practice  do rapes occur on campus  of course they do  it happens everywhere unfortunately but trying to say there is a culture for raping or rapists on campus is just ridiculous
the term  rape culture  does not describe the organized practice of rape but rather the conglomeration of countless social factors that contribute to the conscious and subconscious acceptance and even encouragement of rape  and the truth is
simply because some scholars have manufactured an intellectual discourse that inherently frames the debate in their favor does not make anyone who disagrees with that framework ignorantthere is no such thing as a  rape epidemic  or  rape culture   it is a type of moral panic   0  other examples of recent moral panics include  the false preschool sexual assault case in new jersey a few years ago that led to innocent teachers being incarcerated for yearsthe gross exaggeration of the use of date rape drugs in the 1990sthe first and second red scaresand the salem witch trials   id  you are making two extraordinary claims  first
thank you
you re welcome  this shit boils my blood more than you will ever know
i ca nt give you any statistics but i can speak as a female student here
what an unhappy story  you have my sympathy  it is persuasive as evidence in this debate

1  the bogus  1 in 4 females being rape statistic  has been debunked for years  the study that delusional feminazi s use for this claim was the one done by mary koss in 1985 which she even admits was faulted by her use of extremely wide rape definitions where things like  regretting it later  counted as rape  the best studies we have come from the data collected by the fbi and show that the real prevalence is 52 per 100
also
seriously
love still a boy
consent would not have been possible   given the author s description of the situation
so you re asking the right questions  let s examine the legal framework in new jerseysexual assault is defined under njsa 2c141 first
i think that you re forgetting the basic definition of rape  sex forced upon an unwilling victim  if you bothered to read this girl s testimony in the new york times article
if you know that when you re drunk
i mean
she does nt even go here
fail at overused comedic trope
there s no agony a human being can experience worse than rape  really  you ca nt think of anything worse than rape  have you ever
have u heard of a thing called the spect  there are people who ve witnessed their loved ones spend nite after nite at the spect office and die and u have the nerve to say war is worse than rape   the spect is the worst thing about the univ erse
do nt pretend to know how something feels if you have nt experienced it  and trying to belittle rape by comparing it to war is disrespectful to the victims who have experienced and belittling the suffering and mental anguish that they do go through by being violently humiliated in the most invasive way a woman can possibly be violated  so before you write an insensitive
survivors of rape often suffer immense psychological consequences as a result of the assault  this should not be diminished and the moral relativism of comparing it to war are uncalled for  for where does that lead us  diminishing the indignity experienced by victims of home invasions because it does nt compare to war  comparing apples and oranges is intellectually lazywhile we re on the subject of the mental anguish of survivors i think it is wise to point out that one interesting study suggested that rape survivors who physically and verbally resist  even if unsuccessful  are much less likely to experience psychological trauma  for this reason it can not be stated strongly enough that men and women should be encouraged to resist when at all feasible  i am aware that many victims freeze up at the moment but i think that ex ante incentives to resist andor martial arts training programs may do more to ease the psychological burden of future victims than a lot of the programs we currently invest in
i get where you re coming from  but i m not so sure that rape  and other forms of sexual violence  can really even be compared to other violent crimes like murder
i get where you re coming from  but i m not so sure that rape  and other forms of sexual violence  can really even be compared to other violent crimes like murder
jesus will specsucks stop posting this everywhere
yeah
posting it  wow
senior cruise 20 is open to everyone  does nt mean that the person making these lists is a senior
dae remeber cumbandsuckswordpresscom
for the mras wringing their hands  but what if i was drunk when i violated her consent
bwog
what the professor said is true  the black letter statement of the law is that intoxication never serves to invalidate mens rea unless the intoxication was nonvoluntary  alcoholism is not considered nonvoluntary   but
what you re saying about intoxication is obviously true  if a man is intoxicated and forcibly has sex with a woman without her consent
at this point i either want to be able to read the list or stop hearing about itpreferably the latter
no one is arguing that a man should be allowed to rape if he is drunk  do you allow for such strawman arguments in those papers you are grading  the argument is clearly more along the lines of  if both parties are drunk
thank you  glad someone gets it  guess columbia hires any old idiot nowadays  thanks
everyone in the comments is referring to and quoting an article but all i see is a picture of the listwhat s going on
just want to point out that a majority of these comments claiming that sexual assault on campus is nt that big a deal are written by one guy  track that shit  he even replies to himself in the third person
the fabled  men s rights activist   one guy on the internet that talks to himself
to bronies
to that sad little person who s having a conversation with himself about how rape is imaginary andor exaggerated
track
harassment and defamation lawsuits are next
cringe  fail at singlehandedly trying to delegitimize the severity of sexual assault and making up over 40  of all comments on this thread
dammit bwog
thanks for proving my point
track
i hope she has pet insurance
of course cnn only interviews women  discrimination  mensrights
im pretty sure they interviewed everyone who volunteered to talk  honestly with the media attention this is getting right now anyone who wants to tell their story has more than enough space to do soreally proud of zoe and everyone else involved in the fight to make columbia a safer place
i m fairly sure that it s just a trolllame sarcasm  i do nt think anyone has seriously said  men s rights  in awhile  outside of dark corners of the internet  and the hashtags just highlight the absurdity
none of the  counterarguments  to what the women interviewed are saying depend on a man s perspective
i d hit it
rape culture engages in crude stereotyping that relies upon buzzwords
do nt you need permission from admin to film on campus
yes they do need permisssion  this is a private school  i wonder if cnn obtained it
yes
i m really proud of the courage these women expressed by speaking about their attacks publicly  it is a true testament to their strength  i m honored to be a part of the same community as them
the publicity of this is really getting out of hand now  is nt there any other news going on in the world  women are raped and multilated everyday in africa and no one cares
i sort of agree
this is becoming extremely blurred
i agree  the press is blowing this way out of proportion  out of the over 29
i love zoe  she is so amazing and inspiring  proud to know her   3
they were drinking
correct
lucky for you no one raped you
yes i was
yeah
i admire your courage for sharing your experience with us  without this information
sarah yee is amazing and so strong  i hope you know how much impact sharing your story can have
columbia is a disgusting institution  to think that these places have so much influence over the american power structure  it explains why america continues to decline  these are the  brightest minds  of america
kep
you 3 ladies are fucking incredible  thank you  thank you thank you thank you
i do nt know  i definitely wish my sexual assaulter had been taken off campus  so many triggers
finally a voice of reason
i completely agree
i agree with you  you re not retarded like the rest of the student body  that s rare
are you saying it s harder to be a rapist than it is to be raped  i m sorry
first
this was supposed to be in reply to the person who said the press was blowing this  way out of proportion   the captcha was really hard okay guys
i m so incredibly thankful to these women for coming forward and speaking about their experiences  they re amazing
why are nt more survivors going to the police instead of university bureaucrats
this is a question i have had as well
because there is generally no evidence
and you think that s a good thing  there should be a lower standard of evidence  why not just go get mob justice  that has the lowest standard of evidenceabsolutely none  we must uphold innocence until proven guilty
i ca nt believe a staff member suggested going and talking to her assaulter in his room after the incident  how fucking insensitive and unhelpful
publicity stunt
thank you for having the courage to share your stories
i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness
why is everyone s first instinct to belittle the women who come forward as sexual assault victims
wan na play a game called just the tip
you have three papers to dobut you really had to poodid nt you    something something  a one
so we wrote this song about your stool
arvin is one of those people that defined my columbia experience

congrats flecks crushe  i knew you could do it
what kind of gpa are we talking here  i know the cc valsal were like 405406
woo hal  very well deserved
i ve heard rumors about alden s from back in the day  if they re true

good god
i have so many words i do nt even know what to write but you guys are the best ever and if you want to live in my closet that d be bomb and literally you both do nt even realize how amazing your happiness and kindness and overall shining staresque qualities are like and clairemahima clairemahimerson you guys are the bomb  3  3  3  3  3  3  3 also hi
they sound insufferable
clairemahima are  combined and separate  three of the best things about columbia  thank you for bringing spontaneity
get married
claire and mahima are probably the two besthearted people i have met during my time at here  they are generous
this reads like a stress dream
these guys are really the nicest  333
this is weird
i think this is an awesome variation on the regular seniorwisdom formula  also
find a room
ooooooooooooooooooooooo
hi

so much medicine for these two they themselves are the good  best  people wowee
claire i would date the shit out of you
claire i would date the shit out of you
quite possibly the worst senior wisdom i ve ever read and there are quite a few terrible ones
the thing about this senior wisdom is that it s only truly understandable within the context of clairemahima clairemahimerson  and if you ve had the utter privilege of knowing these two ladies
that is nt the point of senior wisdoms  this should be understandable beyond their own friend group
maybe you should read this senior wisdom postfinals
claire and mahima i wanted you to do one and now it s here my dream come true  caitlin
claire  mahima
this post makes me really glad i did nt get to know them better
forever
yo
they actually make me want to be a worse person
ok you guys are perfect
yall are the very best of ladies
to all the debbydownerspartypoopers commenting on this post  shush  if you ca nt handle the clairemahima clairemahimerson funny business
thank you for doing what the university does nt
no  why thank them  i would feel more apt to do so when they are consistent with the application of their statement
you write the comments
does nt it feel like we re always being told how horrible bwog comments are
yep
the comments have gotten a lot nicer over the years too  observe
columbia has rape tourette s
who was the guy who got sacked
1  aside from receiving an anonymous tip
1  they mention in the article that the person was confrontedheshe likely confirmed the story
1  they mention in the article that the person was confrontedheshe likely confirmed the story
your facts are raping me and hurting my feelings that this guy is guilty of rape merely because he was accuseddownboated
hodor  hodor  hodor  hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor

you ca nt steal my joke  damn you fake hodor
how could you make such a statement
this is really hard to masturbate to
you think you had a hard time
hehe  a hard timehehe
one sympathizes
all you star wars nerds
may the force be ever in your favor
you get used to it after a while
regardless of what you think of the editor s removal
no  someone needs to step in and revoke the blue and white s standing on campus  disgusting
the blue and white  bwog
for anon
thanks for the comment from the peanut gallery
bwog needs to be taken down once and for all  shameful  journalism   read the lion
well you guys did rape theta s reputation so
that was christian zhang over at spec yo
that was theta
our decision does not reflect a position on the innocence or guilt of this former staff member
can you unblur the names  i want to make sure i m not on that list
is too fucking real
uhm
you are fundamentally not understanding why 999  of guys are scared by this
wow must suck to be scared all the time imagine how 100  of the women on this campus feel
just because you are scared 100  of the time does not mean that 100  of the people are scared   75  of the time
yeah
yes
i m not scared at all by the lists
it seems you ve never heard of something called due process  if you have no problem with the lists in any way then you re saying you do nt have a problem with vigilante justice
the fear i have has nothing to do with respect for women  the fear comes from the simple fact that there are bad people in the world  i mentioned this in a comment on another article
335 am it s a long way from lists of alleged rapists written on bathroom stalls and fucking lynchings wow you need to stop  also not sure how this fits into vigilante justice or  mob mentality   i think if either of those were present in regards to this issue students who violated another would be
every single guy i ve known who said he was  falsely accused  of sexual assault  i ve known a few  treated women in such a deplorable way that i would nt have been surprised if those  false accusations  were not
the label  sexual assault  has lost all meaning  it used to mean forced andor nonconsensual sex  now it means any sex that a woman later decides she did nt really like andor regretsit s the essence of the  enthusiastic  consent movement  sure i agreed to sleep with him  consented
if you are able to give consent
the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much short than we think
shorter
can we unblur the names so us ladies know who to avoid for a really really bad time
good on bwog  wish this had happened before the pics were released
the bwog post about the pics
i totally agree  i think this is a powerful show of what it looks like to make a tough call in order to stand up for a safer community and challenge rape
so if you want to get someone kicked off of bwog all you have to do is accuse them of something  that seems a pretty low bar to set even for bwog
nice try  they were found responsible and owned up to it according to the list and this post
actually if you read the article it says they asked him if he had been accused and he said he had
actually if you read the article it says  as a reiteration of our continued work against rape culture
are you guys going to remove  ask your members to downvote everything that puts you guys in a bad light  not only did my comment get removed
if you posted a comment that was removed
do you have any examples of defamed students
this was a response to  frustrated
since when has bwog cared about conflicts of interest  you have had staff members report on issues in which they ve had huge personal conflicts throughout the year   being a member of sjp and reporting on the barnard s banner ban etc   i guess its ok to have conflicts of interest so as long as its not something as controversial as sexual assault  bwog needs to stop pretending they have journalistic  or really any kind of  ethics
yes  and let s not forget bwog endorsing one of its own for a political office
when i got into this school
really  honestly i m kinda surprised hodor made it in
i was signed to columbia at a young age from an academy in france  they were impressed with my top top quality and mental strength
whoever you are
let s go back to last year when a certain person was accused of a hate crime  neither innocent or guilty at the time  with the case being later dismissed
chad washington s hate crime was first picked up by nbc  check the link  because the victim reported it to the nypd  as some commenters on other posts have noted
i do nt think bwog needs to push gossip to be a relevantentertaining news source  do you  how about a simple banremoval on ad hominem attacks  recall
did you really miss that the whole point of this article is to provide transparency without releasing actual names thereby eliminating the possibility of ruining the alleged perpetrator s reputation on the  forever savablesearchable internet
oh
veryrarecomment  fuckjakeover  whotaughtyouthewordadhominem
let me be perfectly clear   allowing this staffer to continue his affiliation with bwog would  not  have tacitly endorsed a rape culture we so firmly stand against   got it  you are nt endorsing anything but common sense and simple justice when you allow someone to go about their business with a minimum of obstruction until they have been accused of a serious crime on the basis of something more substantive than an  anonymous tip   the conflict of interest is a separate subject entirely  of course it can be difficult to write objectively about an ongoing story when the focus of the story is one of your staff  but this sentence crossed a line
it seems pretty likely that this person was indeed found responsible of the charges by the university
i m not scared at all by the lists
being gay does nt really help  men can get raped too
guilty until proven innocent  ca nt wait to release my list of all the known female rapists at columbiabarnard  i will plaster their names across every inch of the campus  then
tips fedora
that was in response to my mra friend above
the witch hunt continues
just wanted to note that while false accusations of rape do occur
i really
to this comment
if a boss asking a worker for sex is rape
it s not rape
oh
because all women are perfect angels who never do anything unethical
yeah those dirty feminists ruin all the fun
ily bwog  3  3  3  3
so you sacked some poor guy cause his name was scribbled on a bathroom wall  holy fuck you guys are idiots
actually
no  they addressed the issue with their staff previously  before this incident
how can your actions not reflect a stance on the individual s guilt  you would nt do this to someone you believed to be falsely accused and innocent  not only does this action imply guilt
there is a way war in our society being waged against beta men  beta men are being assaulted by the three  holy  groups  alpha pluses
this is actually a really fucking intelligent comment  there are others who are nt mindless sheep  very comforting to know  it s just that men need to learn how to have more respect for themselves  do nt be so desperate for puss
the pussy  is accompanied by human brains with thoughts
those aspects of the person are paid lipservice to
if you re upset about your lack of confidence and romantic failures
you only want us to worship you  but it is nt going to happen  i do have a goali will earn as much wealth as i can and i will transfer all of it to the cayman islands  at the end of my life
you know
arrest and expel the vandals  disgusting subhuman filth  hope they never taste an ounce of happiness in their pathetic
except he was guilty and pleaded guilty  this guy was a friend of a friend  check the cnn story bwog just posted
our decision does not reflect a position on the innocence or guilt of this former staff member
this is really uncool  you booted someone for an anonymous tip  you know that s discrimination
it is nt discrimination  it happens all of the time in the real world  they made solid and reasoned arguments
how do we know you even did this  i m not asking how we know the accusations had any validity   i m asking how we know the basic facts that you assert  the usual bwogkreig of publishing as soon as physically possible and iterating is wrong the first time around so damn much that i do nt think you have any credibility to tell us what happened if there s no one else to check  how are your readers going to do your work for you now  how are you going to print print your little  update  we got every fact wrong  at the bottom of the article
i do nt know how these people or bwog wtf that is can sit there and proudly say that  we asked this person accused of alleged rape to resign  because blah blah blah
this is a disgusting action  i am stunned that you do not understand the importance of due process and equal protection under the law  my sincere hope is that all of you are anonymously accused in the same fashion  in fact
it is most likely that the people accused did commit rape  i do not think it was a vendetta against certain individuals  taking it to court would be great  why does nt the university promote that idea  why do nt you promote that idea  why do nt you demand that the university comply with title ix requirements
and exactly how do you know that they probably did  you should search google news for false rape allegations  sometime  it is eyeopening  on campuses
how can there be a court of law
if a man is intoxicated and forcibly has sex with a woman without her consent
there is no such thing as rape cultureanonymous accusations are evidence of nothing  feminism is a hate movement
bwog legal
the irony that you folks removed my comment claiming the five of you had  bad touched  me while acting as you say on an anonymous comment to fire someone is overwhelming
that s not irony  that s libel
to this problem are few and far between because of the nature of the crime  rape is a crime of consent like no other
expelthey are mean in general
sam sam sam
this chick is a beast in the weightroom as well

is out of their damn mind
maybe they re out of their damn minds because their institution has done nothing to protect themselves and others from sexual assault on campus
it does nt matter what the administration is or is nt doing  writing a list of people under investigation will only bias any investigation and possibly throw innocent people under the bus  remember
to attend the same school as they
right
protip  when the people who are appointedin a position tosupposed to protect you and abdicate that responsibility
bahr s article raised some serious concerns over the process  since then
those who want the administration to  do something  should be careful what they wish for  the sexual liberation of the 1960s represents dramatic progress that should not be rolled back  on campus
1  dave chappelle once said that the worst thing you can call someone is crazy
your use of dave chappelle as a moral paragon was really convincing  as much as i love to derive my ethical weltanschauung from the words of a comedian
nice job girls  that s how you make the 11  conviction rate for rape 05
i m the first person to call to attention the flawed statistics involved in those studies  but just because 002  of women experience rape does not mean an 11  conviction rape is excessive  could be 11  is either too high or too low
they should face real consequences  the accused should sue for defamation of character
no one seems to be getting justice herenew policy  let the gods decide  trial by combat
by all means
its fucking got  no one was trying to add the idea of force into the equation  its got
stop what you re doing and go watch game of thrones
there is no such thing as a  rape epidemic  or  rape culture   it is a type of moral panic   0  other examples of recent moral panics include  the false preschool sexual assault case in new jersey a few years ago that led to innocent teachers being incarcerated for yearsthe gross exaggeration of the use of date rape drugs in the 1990sthe first and second red scaresand the salem witch trials   id  you are making two extraordinary claims  first
for anyone who doubts that this  rape culture  stuff is just part of a larger national war against men
links to rmensrightsexpects to be taken seriously
here are the facts1  the bogus  1 in 4 females being rape statistic  has been debunked for years  the study that delusional feminazi s use for this claim was the one done by mary koss in 1985 which she even admits was faulted by her use of extremely wide rape definitions where things like  regretting it later  counted as rape  the best studies we have come from the data collected by the fbi and show that the real prevalence is 52 per 100
both the doj and the white house estimate that 1 in 5 women in america are raped during their lifetimes and that 1 in 5 women who go to college are sexually assaulted while on campus  fbi link does nt actually lead to any information
prison rape is a very real and very serious issue that harms and dehumanizes men indescribably  i doubt many would disagree with you on that  that being said
nice job girls  that s how you make the 11  conviction rate for rape 05
maybe the reason bwog is so  disturbed  is because one of their own is named on this list
i would nt be surprised
there are many things that would make the world safer that are also heinous and unacceptable  deporting all blacks would make new york safer
omg
columbia
the fact that 21 people liked this post
i think you might be misinterpreting the post  it gives an example of an unacceptable action that would increase safety
yes
heinous  does nt even begin to describe what was said in that statement  the audacity that someone would consider this a sound argument is baffling
and if you deported all white people
deport them to where  do you mean the land their parents or grandparents or greatgrandparents or greatgreat grandparents resided in  aka america   or perhaps you mean the country from which their ancestors were forcibly taken 400 years ago  many african americans today do not know from which country in africa their ancestors descended from  their captors did nt exactly keep the best records  so good luck with that
bwog wishy washy about the sexual assault topic  no  they are responsible  rather than making themselves liable for libel they risk maybe being  scooped  in order to maintain their integrity  anna bahr s article  which bwog posted in affiliation with the blue and a white  is what brought national exposure to sexual assault on campus  if you people honestly believe condemning someone as guilty before they are proven to be
bwog seems uncharacteristically shocked and appalled by this whole thing  they re  incredibly disturbed  by this
i assure you that we do not take sexual assault allegations lightly  daniela quintanilla s incredible piece in spectrum  linked in the last paragraph  echoes my own position on the matter
is what op said why the post was delayed  there are no title ix or ferpa issues associated with publishing a blacked out list  which is why spec published it long ago
we do nt consider one list with blurred out names to be news  lists going viral is news  also
you really do nt think someone writing alleged rapists names on a bathroom wall is news
let s examine the legal framework in new jerseysexual assault is defined under njsa 2c141 first
so i m not totally sure why you wrote all of new jersey s legal system because  um we re not in new jerseysecondly
it would be kinda funny if these people werent actual rapists and someone was just mad at them
it is for this reason that these lists are absolutely
was sarcasm i agree with you
they did this in oberlin college and started a witch hunt  it turned out that one of the students they named was a freshman who had been on campus for a week  and they flashed his picture on signs that said  rapist   the group responsible finally admitted that they just picked random people from the freshman class to target
do you have a source on this
toledo blade reported on it  under the heading  some talking more
this is the point when people stop taking the issue of rape on campus seriously  defacing school property with names that may or may not be actual rapists is the same as writing on a wall that so and so is a witch lets burn him  there are many more productive ways to go about this then starting witch hunts  whoever wrote this should be ashamed
bwog ran the blue  white piece that showed that people s rapists  who have been found responsible by the university  are still on campus  if these people have been failed by the proper reporting routes
you re actually going to defend this
this is not about turning survivors into lying failed vigilantes  you re an idiot
ninety percent of these  vigilante vandalism  criticism are wholly valid  but you need to take the past few semesters into account  if the perps are part of the no more red tape campaign  as i suspect they are
i understand the need to fight rapesexual assault on campus
libel  to promote allegations on campus when the public obviously can not substantiate them
is it libel if the people  or at least some of them  were found guilty by the university  i personally happen to know that two of the alleged rapists were suspendedleft the university because of their sexual assault  i assumed that it would nt count as libel in those cases because their guilt was already established by the responsible authority  ie columbia university
i m not a lawyer
makes sense  thanks
truth is never libel  even if it turns out to be false
according to the legal dictionary lawcom  generally speaking
loving the downvotes from bwogees
or fed up with the administration s laissezfaire attitude on rape on campus
we know exactly who wrote these  the same people who ve been quoted in spec and bwog ad nauseum for months about sexual assault
i d be surprised
13 college women are sexually assaulted it s not like the couple of women who were quoted make up that 33   there are so many people who have been assaulted
now it s 13    when did that happen  must be an epidemic since 14 has been the feminist bread and butter stat up until now  a 33  increase is frightening hide yo kids hide yo wife  let s just call it an even 21 or 200   that seems as reasonable
according to the fbi it s 01
here are the facts1  the bogus  1 in 4 females being rape statistic  has been debunked for years  the study that delusional feminazi s use for this claim was the one done by mary koss in 1985 which she even admits was faulted by her use of extremely wide rape definitions where things like  regretting it later  counted as rape  the best studies we have come from the data collected by the fbi and show that the real prevalence is 52 per 100
statistics regarding rape and sexual assault are gathered by a variety of agencies  the national crime victimization survey  ncvs  is the gold standard for crime reporting which gathers comprehensive statistics on crimes ranging from auto theft to burglaryit uses sound scientific statistical methods
i do nt know a single sarah lawrence faculty member that publishes any work  there is no publish or perish mantra there  so you are being overly generous to my undergraduate alma by attributing research to that faculty  but your general point is correct of course  the oftcited statistics are misguided  that alone does nt mean that rape is under or over deterred  from a consequentialist standpoint it is hard to say what activity we re chilling with relaxed actus reus standards in rape cases  do we chill the amount of anonymous onenighters if we make  only yes means yes  the consent standard  sure
whenever people cite a statistic like this i wonder a little bit  33  of women     what   let s assume that every guy is a repeat offender
i do nt think that those people are the writers bc as the poster above me said
though i support the campaign to make cu s treatment of sexual violence more just
also
this is far too intelligent and articulate to be a bwog comment
i am the public safety to the women s bathroom wall that is bwog
you re also not the same person who wrote the comment above
victims might find the procedure leading up to crime difficult  but you can not expect any recourse from extrajudicial sources  the law is perfectly reasonable in scrutinizing all criminal allegations  we would not want to be held accountable to crimes that carry high stigma and prison sentences without exhaustive legal proceedings  keep in mind a felony conviction comes with losing the right to vote and probably never getting a decent job again  so what do you want police to do  not question the victim
keep in mind a felony conviction comes with losing the right to vote and probably never getting a decent job again    correctioni am shocked when such misinformation and prejudice is spread  both of your assertions disproportionately reflect disenfranchisement affecting minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities  new york instituted a ban the box initiative to combat such prejudices
sir or madame i believe you misread me  i was emphasizing how stigmatizing the results of felony conviction can be
whatever secret meeting precipitated this was surely begun with some chanting of  vulvaaaaa
perhaps writing this list  and publishing the triggering work of a campus vigilante  is not the best way to create a safer campus environment for victims    bwog
to clarify  i am not triggered by bwog publishing a blurred out list of rapist s names  the only thing triggering about this is bwog s unbelievably sanctimonious use of the word triggering  in a bullshit context to pretend as though the needs of survivors was at all a concern when determining whether to publish this
seconding the comment above  and i saw the actual names written in lerner and am very glad to know this info so i can avoid these people at all costs
i do nt want to live on this planet anymore
seriously  you do nt even know if these people have been accused
i think the issue here is that whoever wrote this piece ca nt write  by triggering
already commented here
some nutjob writes down a list of alleged sluts on campus
next time a guy pisses a girl off for whatever reason
yeah i wonder what it s life living in perpetual fear
you know what  fuck you and your snark  men die earlier

i mean  if the best you can do is resort to ridicule when the stats do nt back up your preconceived notions of how easy it ostensibly is to be a man in america

men have higher suicide rates and violent deaths because they are more likely to use firearms and highmortality methods   women
how do you really feel about men
firstly
this was actually very helpful  to myself  to read

this reminds me of how
good comparison
throw the rapist down the well
you may be angry  hell
the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves

my main concern is victims being believed

does it not bother people how quickly this can turn into mccarthyism  what s to keep me from defaming an ex  i think it s important for women to be able to see this list but i m not entirely sure we should ostracize these people when their accuser can be shrouded behind a veil of anonymity  in real trials
the people mccarthy went after actually were communists
the best troll
gays can commit rape
pretty sure these were put up in female bathrooms
and women can rape women too
women can also rape men  for instance
in war
why is this conversation centered around protecting alleged perpetrators instead of survivors of sexual assault  why are we so concerned with protecting the integrity of the rapists instead of preventing survivors from being triggered or reminded of their assault when they are simply trying to use the bathroom
my guess is that because in the criminal justice system
that your alias is guy
it s kind of sad your prejudice leads you to think that s an even remotely clever retort  about half of sexual assault victims are men  that does nt make  innocent until proven guilty  any less cogent as a standard in court
oh please  i m not a woman and i was raped on campus  but you do nt see me going around telling other victims how they can and ca nt find justice
justice is a codeword for vengeance  justice in this country  cruel and unusual punishment in others  just gon na get that out there
because there is something in this country called  innocent until proven guilty
i like how you use  alleged perpetrators  and  rapists  interchangeably
because accused individuals are innocent until proven otherwise  now
you re right  some people continue to think that being falsely accused of rape  or even convicted of rape  see media reaction to steubenville  is worse than being an actual victim of sexual assault  rape culture means that we re taught to prioritize the needs of aggressors or potential aggressors over the needs and voices of survivorsit s disgusting
you re right  some people continue to think that being falsely accused of rape  or even convicted of rape  see media reaction to steubenville  is worse than being an actual victim of sexual assault  rape culture means that we re taught to prioritize the needs of aggressors or potential aggressors over the needs and voices of survivorsit s disgustingi agree that the media reaction to steubenville was awful and they should not have been portraying the rapists in such a sympathetic light and ignoring the actual victim  however
the law does not act in the normative fashion you have attributed to it  it is not a matter of prioritizing the harms experienced by victims or alleged perpetrators  we have established a criminal law that exacts heavy punishments in the way of jail time and stigma so we have a high burden of proof for all offenses actionable at criminal law  by contrast the civil law system is limited to injunctive relief and money damages
regardless of the overall merits of manhattanville
sorry
as a victim of sexual assault and harassment since i was 9
they re
wait to wield your story to silence that of others  they are not speaking for you
if they were speaking for themselves then why dont the people writing it admit to it and not be anonymous  i mean maybe they dont want people to shame them  but wait
was nt trying to silence them  just letting them know they do nt speak for everyone or the general movement towards better handling of sexual assault cases on campus
the location of these lists
while that may have been the original intention
it does not assume that men are not raped
but rather simply wished to warn other women  whoever sent these pictures in did so before facilities could take it down  they are probably the same person wrote it  i think that should clear up any concerns about intent
if the perpetrators were the ones submitting the tips
yes but what matters are nt the intentions but the consequences  you should be intellectually mature enough to think through those if you are at this school
i m no expert
the comment i was replying to was deleted

you
in response to the wall street journal link above my comment
interesting  but gross that a selfdescribed feminist sees fit to publish in the murdoch yellow press
and to accept help from fire
sorry
but let s actually talk about this article  the entire article is highly anecdotal  of course a parent would want to believe the best in their son and of course they would see this kind of allegation against her son as unfair to him
wow you girls are fucking retarded  this is why we need to separate from barnard  so glad i left this school  it went from a prestigious college to a fucking middle school  stop ruining my school s reputation  i hate you all
you left the columbia before 1889
the columbia   think i lost some snappiness points there
these lists will only serve to hurt the cause  writing names of alleged attackers in a bathroom stall constitutes slander and completely bypasses the legal system that should deal with these issues  to whomever is writing these  stop now or risk losing supporters on campus
who s going to lose supporters  the list is anonymously written
this whole movement went from a noble inspiring thing to vigilante justice and calls for book burning in like a month fuck this you re making a really important issue seem reactionary and stupid
i can understand why an individual frustrated with the judicial system might be compelled to do something like this  the thought of the person who raped them walking around campus and assaulting others is disturbing  and this
i personally do nt think that people are going to jump at the opportunity to ruin their enemies  and exsignificant others  lives by putting them on the list  how old are we   why do you accept that a human could be monstrous enough to rape another person but not monstrous enough to write another person s name on a bathroom stall
probably because i m naive
i think the reasoning behind that is a smaller
the justice system is actually highly progressive when it comes to rape  if you engaged in comparative legal analysis you would realize that  many states  including new york  have abandoned the force requirement  now the only actus reus requirements are sexual act without consent  proving a lack of consent is similarly lowered  it used to be that you had to express no  ie   no means no   but now many states require an affirmative indication on the part of the victim  ie   only yes means yes    on top of this the low mens rea standard has remained steady as the actus reus standard has been relaxed  thus mistake of fact defenses are routinely tossed out  there has never been a greater time in human history to bring a rape allegation to a court of law  unless you are asking for strict liability exclusively on the basis of an allegation and proof of damages  ie a rape law analogue to products liability law  the legal system really can not go any farther to help victims  this is why criticism of the judicial system is almost exclusively made by laypersons who have not read the statutes related to rape
whatever you say
nice job reciting the facts of florida star
this is a disgusting way to seek out justice  i had supported this movement
just because you do nt like this incident does nt mean you should stop supporting the movement
i bet lenin and stalin said something similar to their followers after the red terror
did you just compare advocating for sexual assault reform to soviet russia
missing the point  comparing a blatant disregard for individual rights as justified toward reaching a noble goal to the justification of foregoing individual rights in other pursuits is not far off base  this has nothing to do with seeking sexual assault reform  classic misdirection by you crazies
there are extremist fringe groups within every movement  including every one you currently support  i m sure the vast majority of people seeking sexual assault reform disapprove of this like you  the real platform consists of effective
i think that the fact that spec was able to verify that at least one of the people on the list actually were faced with disciplinary action due to sexual assault might speak to the likelihood that these were false accusations
wait
i am amazed that so many brilliant minds do not understand why it is wrong to publish these lists  anyone s name could be added to such a list  if you can not imagine someone s name being included falsely then you are truly naive
brilliant minds  half of these students are affirmative action admits
alastair bollinger
i see we have all learned about presumption of innocence in high school civics
update your story
looks like it was the same person who wrote them all
very shocked this happened at an ivy league school
mind your own nyu business
bahahaha
you can read
that this
lol
just saying
although i understand the desire to warn other students about potentially dangerous people on campus as well as the catharsis that survivors may find in writing down the name of their attacker
why are we turning columbia into a court system  if you were mugged you would go to the police right  so why are we reporting rape to the university instead of law enforcement  columbia is nt necessarily equipped with dealing with these sorts of things  also lets completely throw due process out the window  sexual assault is a crime  lets go to the police
this is why we need a men s rights group on campus  expel the vandals
just wanted to note that this dangerous behavior is the same  we must protect ourselves and take the situation into our own hands  mentality that led to a woman being beaten to death as a suspected witch in brazil earlier this week  the students that did this should know better than to perpetuate these kind of backwards actions
this is pathetic  sue

do you hear the people sing
whose names were on the list
may be the only one who thinks this

a lot of people are expressing concerns about due process and  innocent until proven guilty  precedent  i do nt know about the handwritten ones
honestly
i know quite a few people
nice job taking vocab tips from tal fortang
i spent quite a while searching the recesses of the internet for the names on this list
is there anywhere to see the list of names
a lot of people have photos of the original list on their phones
i have a list of murderers  john mccainbarack obamahillary clintonbill deblasiorudy giulianimichael bloombergit s true because i said so    let s go lynch these people

and it sounds like meaningful change resulted from this  good
how do you people not have finals to study for
how hard is sorting comments chronologically
procreation is a biological imperative
the fine ivy league institutions of america are bastions of rape and greed
the blokes merely emulate thier elders  the grantgrubbing professulas who will black list their victims as rabblerousers unable to ever get into any graduate program once th ewhispering begins  this is why we must automate all academic decisionmaking and put all courses online where discretion shall not rule oppressively
seen anything about the lists of rapists that have been written around campus  why has nt bwog posted anything about that  does it have anything to do with the fact that a bwog staffer is on the list
maybe it has to do with the fact that distributing the uncensored list is actually illegal
absolutely no shame  you spend countless hours throughout the semester on each class  3 hours for 20  40  of your grade is nothing  i almost never leave early
this was painful to read and stupid  who cares
great piece
u r great
love pines
ah
yes
no
dear gerardo
a straight    answer to the oral sex question  godspeed young sir
but this kid s cool as shit
i m pretty sure i ve seen nonwhite gays at first friday in my time  then again
i really appreciate you  everything you ve given to different spaces on campus  columbia will miss your thoughtful honesty
this guy thosad i never got to meet him before he graduates
will miss you  good luck
you re wonderful
justifying yourself a logic of capitalism  under capitalism every person has the right to exist just not the right to thrive
that queer experience
it was a joke
i know it s a joke  it s not funny
he meant that oral sex is quite an important part of sex for many gay men  which it kind of it is  i mean
hey i think i know your boyfriend  was he in my arabic class with wijdan
it was tough at times but you re at the finish line now
smoke a joint in ec on halloween two years ago after rosie the riveter and i accidentally crashed a casa latina house party
gon na miss hearing that obnoxious  that was a hint  laugh from all the way across south field and running into you everywhere  you re a great friend and columbia s losing a valuable student this yearalso your  back in my day   response made my soul ache
you re one of the coolest queer ppl i ve ever met and probably  definitely  the coolest qpoc i ve ever met     you inspire me to be more brave  love you gerardo
fuck politics that pit marginalized people against each other  gerardo you re cool  and hilarious
i m not really sure i understand ur comment  if it helps any i meant i m a qwoc and can relate to him more because of our shared identities n experiences as qpoc on this campus  i m not pitting anyone against each other  i did nt put anyone down  lol
is it just me or is this guy simultaneously complaining about being tokenized by columbia while also presenting his identity as solely based on his being latino and gay  which point should i care about
would nt it be more suitable for the building s program if it were an entirely underground structure

barnard s looking to recruit more international students who do nt qualify for aid
i heard that the new library will kill the magnolia   nooooo
towards a death star
the building footprint on that plot of land is so tiny that the cost of engineering anything taller than 30 stories would empty out barnard s endowment multiple times  skyscrapers need thickness and depth to resist wind forces
are you stupid
shhh
the land should be made into a pond  we will name it lake butler
i m worried the new skybrary will cast a big shadow on lehman lawn
as long as it s phallic
i see what you did there
already watches over campus from her apartment window
learn the difference between that and which
barnard already has most of the money already raised  they are planning a 13 story library
now i do nt know a lot about architecture

smoking is a choice  it s a habit with serious negative health ramifications for not just the smoker but everyone nearby  there are ample resources available to help people stop smoking  if you re going to smoke it s not my responsibility to accommodate your addiction at the expense of my clean air  throwing around the word discrimination  like this is an insult to everyone who faces actual discrimination  get a grip
fourteen percent of new yorkers smoke  thats one in seven people  i am that seventh person
just stop smoking  pleaseit s 2014 you do nt look cool
hookah on the lawns  is that still kosher
yes
only if you let public safety smoke it too
is this in regards to weed
muh public health  so glad to see that the usenate has it s priorities in order
but if i m not included will anyone come visit me anymore
they forgot the weed dot behind sipa
do nt ask do nt tell
oh please
but what if my bong has a gas mask
i ve quit smoking
shut the fuck up you big bitch
this is dumbbbbbb  nobody ever stopped smoking in front butler in the first place  there is nt any ban to reverse
personally when this ban goes into affect im going to use my super soaker on anyone smoking outside of the designated areas
as a smoker
the butler smoke zone is real
thank you  you have the right to smoke
i am so in favor of this policy
as my post above said  having asthma at columbia is the worst  like i like to breathe and stuff  i sleep with my nebulizer here more than i did at home  where 20  of the population are smokers and smoking is allowed in bars still
it s especially hard to avoid smokers now that the bleacherstents are up for graduationbarnard campus is smokefree
do you  ew smoking is bad  idiots realize that the ban has stopped exactly zero people from smoking on campus  all of these  designated smoking areas  will amount to is urns being installed
sorry but all you nerds are basic  my dad smoked all his life and is still aroundchill out and let the artists and rockstars and hipsters do their thingpeace
this map is basically the whole campus  except walkways and inhospitable flowerbeds  when you realize that the smoke will inevitable escape your little red dots
ew  make columbia smoke free
columbia would be better  ew  free
they should just make the entire campus smoke free  we are in new york city  if you re seriously itching to have a smoke
smoking prevents tuberculosis
one big reason smoking looks cool and devilmaycare is because in some ways it is  if you have a highoctane lifestyle and stand a decent chance of dying tomorrow
how far away from campus can people hear the screaming
they can hear it all the way across the narrow sea

the lists of rapists that have been written around campus  why has nt bwog posted anything about that  does it have anything to do with the fact that a bwog staffer is on the list

sarina is awesome and hilarious and a mega babe  columbia will miss you
i love you and i love this    fantastic quote  also 7 classes who are you
xe  canunotjpg
i mean
grammatically incorrect
grammar evolves bro
if you re going to say  they  instead of  he  or  she
and how is making up a word correct
it s quite uncouth to ask what one will do after graduation
i m pretty sure this is where sarina is going
i m glad you slept 10 hours a night while taking 7 courses
there is no aspect of yourself that is not beautiful

sorry
eddy s too nice
nope  thank you anonymous defenderbtw my best semester was when i was taking fivesix cs classes
i love sarina  was almost about to ask her out till i found that she was already taken
i hear she s going steady with eric wohlstadter  what a power couple
econ  football
this is physically impossible  standard ncaa football field dimensions are 5333x120 yards  this does nt even include room for bleachers or other infrastructure  after looking at scaling
it s an eight minute shuttle ride door to door to baker  the athletic complex up there is impressive
8 minutes  i ve been taking the wrong shuttle
if you can make it doortodoor from any undergrad dorm to any building at baker in 8 minutes or less bwog will pay you  20
baker field is five miles away

trigger warning omg
it s not an 8 minute shuttle ride
we win at economics and finance more so than we do at football
as incredible as a real field on campus would be
more realistically
that plan was only for indoor sports  when it fell through
some of columbia s best years under lou little including a victory in the 1934 rose bowl against stanford and the defeat of the army squad in 1947 which at the time was threetime consecutive national champions and had nt lost a game since 1943
indeed  we re not the only school whose teams play offcampus  ucla plays most of its games at the rose bowl
this  hell
the band has never played with only a hint of attitude
put it in morningside park  imagine a stadium with the west side bleachers built into the dropoff at 116th
why is the dean of the business school holding onto the money and delaying the construction of the new business school buldings  all the money has been raised
the bschool had nt raised all of the money a couple of months ago  i doubt it has since  the plans and the site wo nt necessarily be ready as soon as the funds are available  the infrastructure underneath also has to be designed and funded
i thought they started running shuttle buses via the henry hudson parkway  or is that only for the athletes
why are there only humanities professors on here
there are some from engineering
as for the rest
only spotted one engineering professor  jeffrey w kysar professor of mechanical engineeringmaybe the letter started with some humanities professor and they did nt know anyone in scienceengineering
they were too busy on wall street
do you even have any idea what you re talking about
thank you for this
makes me proud
none of my professors are on there i guess i can expect them all to rape me with their finals
this is awful but i laughed oh dear god yes i laughed ahahahahhaha
i m going to hell
please
no
seriously
i was abused as a child and whenever i hear about our football team getting beat i feel like the pain i went through does nt matter and domestic violence is nt a big deal  please consider my feelings
you really think you re being smart
yeah im sorry i know what its like to get raped  freshman year calc 2 final the memories are so painful
come on man  are your jokes worth more to you than someone s pain
why would you assume i am a man  so heteronormative
is someones pain worth more than everyone s jokes  which would you rather encourage
that s the stupidest fucking thing i ve ever heard  the jokes are nt funny and endorsing rape jokes augments the pain of survivors  it does nt privilege it
1 its not a rape joke
odds are extremely high that someone very close to you  friend
for those of you who do nt think that it s a big deal to make these small jokes  as i did a few minutes ago before i actually thought about it
yeah i mean if i said  that physics final destroyed my mind  everyone who knows someoneis someone who has brain damage or has been hit in the head should be offended right
go on your way and sell your story to lifetime
as a survivor who has taken classes with several of the professors on this list
this is so bittersweet
i m sure a lot more support it than those who were in these limited circles  as someone said above
many nontenured profs may feel like than can not speak out against the university for fear of losing their job
i see at least one nontenured professor on the list  i understand that not all professors feel that they are able to criticize the university
good work beating spec to their own oped
lol
proud to see some of my favorite professors on here
sharyn ohalloran
usenate eboard chair
she is bollinger s crony and is the reason why the usenate has nt done anything marginally critical for years  guess signing this list is a way of giving lip service
thank you so much to the faculty members who signed this  having your support means so much to us
as a survivor
members of the bccu soc department have signed this and it just warms my heart  choosing this major was the best thing i did with my 4 years here
as a survivor
for the past few weeks
you do nt go to columbia
mhm
for christ s sake
you do realize that this is a problem on all college campuses
yes i do
suk mai dik
its
literally not a single professor in math
good  they ve got better things to do than pander to this bullshit feminist circlejerk
it s because the humanities and soc science professors all circulated this amongst themselves while not really reaching over to the seas faculty  that s just speculation on my part
while i think this is awesome and give props to the professors who showed support
for those wondering  i m pretty sure this was nt circulated to the whole entire faculty of the university  i think it was written by certain professors and sent around through their networks  though it was shared pretty widely
dmow  deborah mowshowitz   she s probably too busy making psets for those poor premeds
for those wondering  i m pretty sure this was nt circulated to the whole entire faculty of the university
someone s got ta be the bad guy
adopt me
oh man i love that woman
but james schamus  such an important and influential person to have the support of
yes she changed my life not even kidding
this was a reply to the tadiar comment above  because yes  you are not alone
oops i accidentally a word   it  refers to not making rape jokes  as in not making rape jokes does nt endorse pain   figured that was clear from context but i m amending it anyways
i am on the faculty of the computer science department
i m a signer  let me clarify that the letter did in fact travel by email across faculty social networks which are  as you might expect  shaped by their disciplinary locations  an effort was made to circulate it widely
what was the rush in getting it out  was it to beat the end of the academic year

hey shamus im a student in your class and i want to know if you want to 420 blaze it with me sometime this week before i graduate  if you do just write the letter h on the board during our final

professor khan
shamus i give you an a
i bet falsely accused students feel alone  did you ever think of that  or
that the insane amount of lipservice this issue has been getting over the course of this semester will amount to just that  lipservicei personally do nt get this community s insistence on making a big show out of how sexual assault is wrong
read prof khan s response above
very true  and everyone loves to blame the administration  we all know what they have to offer in return  extra layers of bureaucracy
say there are a bunch of profs who signed from one dept
this makes me feel good about our community
professors rushing to please the irrational mob

this is ridiculous  you do nt get to choose what has already been written in the literary classics  so we just do nt read anything ever the works contain violentsexually violent moments  they odyssey just does nt matter anymore because of those instances in the content  it s not the content we re reading
the odyssey
i do nt think that s the authors  point  they re saying that a lot of times this material goes unexamined and unproblematized  as they said   most lit hum classrooms do lip service to misogyny in the syllabus
see i understand the need to  problematize  the texts which i think ultimately needs to come from both the professor and the students
personally
go away
war is bad  no more thucydidies  too heteronormative  adios don quixote  where are the gay couples  see ya jane austin  democracy  monarchy  so long king lear
austin
did you even read the piece
thucidides
lit hum is supposed to be the intellectual starting point on this campus
so let s examine it  in fact
i do nt see why removing works from the core is so bad  you need to take someone out to make way for the texts that have been deliberately silenced for a very long time
it s not censoring if you re deciding based on merit  you seem to think that the texts in lit hum are  unquestionably  valuable and inherently brilliant  let me ask you this  have you ever thought about
but they were products of their time  your opinion is a product of our time
the times were also a product of their opinions
what he said
i really do nt think people are grasping the criteria for selection of works in lit hum and cc  while some nebulous notion of  quality  is perhaps an aspect of the criteria for selection
thank you so much for writing this
and i salute bwog for writing this  i honestly do nt get how you people just like
did you even read this
lit hum is officially called  masterpieces of western literature and philosophy  for a reason  how many poc authors do you expect to see  one of your concerns is that the core is heavily westernized
how many poc authors do you expect to see   oh of course the west has noooo poc writers historically  non at all  pocs absolutely did not exist before  they are a modern day invention   however
that first comment   well shit   just got eviscerated  clearly some of us learned critical thinking skills in lit hum and others
no one is saying books by poc are terrible  you are misunderstanding the earlier commenthave you ever read  a room of one s own  by virginia woolf  the point is similar  it is not that women are inferior and were unable to produce literature at the time  it was that the conditions made it nearly impossible for women to write  many jane austens
and by the way
the point is nt to have a syllabus that s clean and pure and pc  for me
loud noises
you rock
there are entire majors and intellectual fields dedicated to studying what you re interested in  please go away  if you do nt like the core
it s not about personal  interest   it s about which voices are established and enforced as universal  why should these voices be accepted as the universal default for being  cultured  or  educated  while others are regulated to  special interest  classes  the fact is that right now
no  you do nt have to learn about  only  these books  there are so many other classes that you re encouraged to take to learn about all these things that you are clearly also interested in  there s a whole literary tradition that responds to the canon in the exact same way that you are doing right now  many of brilliant intellectuals that agree with you  it s not columbia who decides that these are the masterpieces  they are masterpieces of western literature because they form its foundation  literature responds
i m just saying lets not ignore the fact that lithum is mandatory and these other classestexts are optional    that does show something about values
just cuckolded these feminizesboo yah
my professor
the problem is nt masterpieces of western lit  the problem is the lack of an equivalent with regards to global lit and philosophy  global core is such a broad
preach  and also loud noises
it seems that you were focusing on the wrong aspects of these works  you ve wasted a good year
you clearly wasted a good year drinking up the koolaid
geeeeeetttttttttttt itttttttttttttt
all the people up in arms about  censorship ooohhh nooo what about our intellectual freeedommmsss   besides the obvious point that this editorial is nt at all calling for censorship of the core
the canon did not come to be by  the systematic silencing of any voices outside the dominant pov and a long legacy of ignoring the contributions of marginalized people  just no  that s just not true  first of all
you maintain that  the canon did nt come to be by systematic silencing  but you admit that  inclusion implies exclusion   i think you just contradicted yourself there
just because the core is predominantly white and male does not mean minorities are systematically ignored   did i read that correctly  you re doing a great service to these  masterpieces  with your masterful ability to construct a coherent argument
you wrote   the canon did not come to be by  the systematic silencing of any voices outside the dominant pov and a long legacy of ignoring the contributions of marginalized people  just no  that s just not true   enlighten us
oh person who speaks for all women and people of color  kindly stop savoring the smell of your own farts long enough to realize you sound like a righteous prick
and now i m laughing at you
why does it matter if voices were silenced in the creating of the canon  of course they were  and that was wrong  but because they were
the bulk of good literature  lol
literary past  is not a funny term  these books are not arbitrarily chosen  as the beall and endall of intellectualism and literary value   the point of these books is that they make up the foundation for most of literature  in one way or another all literature is responding or rejecting or reacting in some way to the ideas and worlds presented in these texts  in the exact same way that you are reacting  if you had never read these texts
you want to read books by authors of color
you wan na read a book by a woman
have you never heard of

1 hundreds of slave narratives
do nt know who any of these people are  probably cause they were nt too good
are you trying to make yourself sound stupid and ignorant  legit question though  have you ever considered that maybe instead your viewpoint is flawed
you do nt think harper lee s good  lol sounds like you re in the minority bud  they must not have good literature on the planet zorg or wherever you re from
i really do nt know what to tell you if you do nt know who mary shelley  frankenstein
yes i agree with your list of great authors outside the  white male  paradigm
booker t washington is not a good person  he told freed slaves to  put down their buckets  and keep working for their former slaveowners
so basically
i also do nt know that thi education is being  given   in many cases
i was in a barnard first year english class during my freshman year
thank you
im a survivor  im not gon give up  im gon work harder  im a survivor
that was nt very beyonce of you
hey bc
does nt even go here   boooooo
stayed tuned for the hottest reality tvshow of the summernbc s survivor
eat the cake
a psa to everyone in cc  people who take the core are not the only people in the world who have read these works  high schoolers read these texts  students at state schools
if you did nt like it you shouldnta put a ring on it
hunger games
thank you for writing this comment  very upset that there are people out there who down voted it
that s pretty messed up
that s not the point  while many people did have good experiences with their lithumfye professors
when i did meet with her
literary past  is a funny term  whose literary past are we talking about exactly  when you say  the point of these books is that they make up the foundation for most of literature
where are my dragons
haven  t seen you naked all season  what gives
the iliad made surprisingly good rolling papers
really  i thought it made much better toilet paper
it s not about personal  interest   it s about which voices are established and enforced as universal  why should these voices be accepted as the universal default for being  cultured  or  educated  while others are regulated to  special interest  classes  the fact is that right now
most people arent greeks fighting in a war for the prospects of glory or honor  most people arent poets traversing the depths of hell  most people are nt young women growing up in a household in the 1800s obsessing over who they re going to marry  the point of the lit hum works is nt the characters
thank you for this  we could be reading twilight and still have discussions about the human experiences  focusing on the race of the authors completely misses the point of lit hum and cc
you re def one of those  i m not racist
a lot of the  pc police       comments are from people who clearly did nt read  or at least did nt understand  the articlemiles
all the commenters talkin abt how lithum is the pinnacle of all literature are fake af
your writing is impeccable
yes
darragh is my boy
i wish i d had darragh   i heard nothing but good things from people in his class
please read the oped fully before jumping to conclusions and commenting ty
at least one person literally read all the lithum books cover to cover
the point of reading the books is to get smarter and develop a logical way of thinking  i do nt remember a single fact from most of the math classes i took at columbia but i like to think they still served a purpose  this analysis misses the point of the core  the content is really secondary
the point of reading the books is to get smarter   derp
my lit hum class spent ages discussing how problematic the misogyny and rampant rape culture are in the books we readagesjust because your prof did nt do it does nt mean everyone s prof didnti wholeheartedly agree that this is a question worth discussing but i would not be so quick to accuse columbia of something that it is already trying to remedy
something can be a  masterpiece  and still have problematic shit in it fyi
you think people who ve studied the philosophical masterpieces of the western canon would be able to grasp this simple concept
manannnnn          i love you  marry me
i agree  i think that the argument for the diversification of the core often presumes that the identity of the authors has an impact on the books  reception
the author s whole point was that we need to discuss this in lithum if we want any chance of getting it fixed on campus
the above comment about censorship is a good one  in order to not repeat the past we must first understand it  understanding the inherent misogyny engrained into our  literary past
definitely happy to have a civil discourse  and on the off chance you d be cool putting your contact info down
this was supposed to be a reply to the first thread wayyyyyyy up at the top
i m all for questioning the content of the syllabus and examining whether or not different texts from different people should be includedbut please can we stop acting like the books that are there are nt fucking amazing  sure
this  a thousand times this
question the syllabus
censor everything  new rule  if a the r word is mentioned ever
bwog

yall better check that
sup ya ll  lem me just say that all 5 of my facebook  followers  have been receiving constant updates about this article  we are planning on staging a protest in front of low library  i m expecting about 50  turnout
that these kind of figures keep getting blurted out uncritically is incredible  everyone who believes  1in4  is close to the truth should 1  read the following  2  think about the damage that this erroneous belief can cause  debunking the numbers
what exactly is your problem with college students defending themselves
this piece is incredibly condescending  you seem to think that you are the only smart person at columbia and that everyone else is a blind sheep who supports everything that we read in classsupports anything that the textbook author says and anything uttered from the teacher s mouth  i read about odysseus
thank you  this exactly
the exact point of the core is to start a discussion of how these topics relate to us today
the exact point of the core is to start a discussion of how the issues relate to us today
these kinds of articles tend to suggest that we create  canons  out of thin air
i m so sick of  well meaning   underclass  wo  men touting wgs 101 arguments without  1  going beyond what their prof judith butler says and  2  denouncing everything that does nt conform  please people
make the world in my image  silence all dissenters  remove all fear  whitewash the walls of this prison  blindfold the prisoners  we are happy now
itt people looking for something to be offended byrape and violence are perennial facts of human existence  they are terrible and not good to think about  if you ca nt handle their being mentioned
i think the point that the author is trying to make is that no amount of external discussion will be sufficient if we do nt stop teaching firstyears the values in lithum  the whole point is that lithum teaches some really misogynistic shit and is still presented as a beautiful gift we should all be so grateful to absorb
i just want to say that in my fye  legacy of the mediterranean  the first thing we read was  leda and the swan  by yeats and talked about rape and rape culture  all hail margaret vandenburg
what do we mean when we group all these authors under the category of  white males   augustine
jane austen
there is no book more violent
wow  you had nothing better to say so you had to go and attack the author personally rather than attacking their viewsarticle  very mature of you  and certainly makes everything and anything you say very valid  you ca nt even counter their argument  how could you possibly speak for who they are and their personality
well
i hate these pc ppl caring about rape ughh  so intellectually lazy ughhh pc pc
is it really out of the realm of possibility
complicit
try not to get too worked up  try harder sista
i m surprised nobody has pointed out that many of our most revered women writers stood apart
i propose that the word  fuck  be destroyed and buried because it condones rape culture  what more fitting than to destroy an old word
could nt have said it better  we re so focused on criticizing everything that we miss the opportunity to learn
very puzzled by this piece from the get go  i find it a strange suggestion that to portray rape or violence in a book is to endorse rape or violence
to put something on a syllabus is not a statement of  this book is good and you should agree with it
simone de beauvoir passed her female students on to her rapist husband and was complicit in his predatory behavior towards her students    sartre preyed ruthlessly on confused young women
simone de beauvoir was a pedophile and rapist  beauvoir was known to have a number of female lovers  the nature of some of these relationships
i too can ignore finals
so it s okay to exclude historically important women and poc from the  important  standard because they were fucked up people
is just an afterthought  it s like saying  hey
apparently men are too stupid to not become rapists if they read about a rape  the misandrist author ignores rape of men in the odyssey because men ca nt be raped    so i propose that the following violencefree
i see this as part of a much larger trend of resistance to critical thought as well as a lack of empathyi absolutely have sympathy for survivors of sexual assault  i am a feminist  i have experienced what some may call sexual assault  yet i do nt see what personal unfortunate
wow do nt think i ve ever been more hurt by a bwog comment   this is nt funny
you should be ashamed of yourself
you should have made it cake shaped
rape
thank you bwog for removing the post that my original comment was in reply too
and people still question if rape culture is a thing
now that the offending comment has been deleted by bwog a few of these comments are standing along and look like they re trolling

i was gon na say that they all looked like bc2017
what  that does nt make any sense
some students are invited to attend because they re receiving a named scholarship and the creators of the scholarship are attending  your classmates are nt all dropping cash to go
instead of focusing on the enormous good that this gala does for the school by raising money
i think she did go over the gala s  good   did you read the bit about the scholarship girls she met  she talked about  class divide  but also definitely talked about how it s mostly just alcohol and a party  and i do nt think it is appropriate to criticize her journalism of all things because she talked about class  calling the author  whiny and jealous  seems unfair
chill  none of this read as whiny  a little selfserving maybe
i think the fact that the author titled the article  dropping cash
clearly you do nt realize that authors do nt usually come up with the titles
why do you have the time for this
who made you in charge of ruining everything

this week
repeatedly threatened one of the male attendees with threats  sounds threatening
this is terribly written
if there was a guy making those threats
tonight the spec representative at the meeting clarified the serious threat last night that caused third party intervention was against the current board
that is incorrect  the claimed threat of violence by the board is still unsubstantiated  miles grantham
did cucr ask all campus media to remove the list of names  why did bwog take it down but spec s article in spectrum still have their names
the dissenters sent the statement to bwog with their names on it
ow  dammit bwog
his name is miles grantham
and by the way
did it ever occur to you that the cucr board might have been looking out for the safety of the people who revolted and not their own safety  just a thought
of course it occurred to me  yet at the town hall meeting last night  on monday
as a diehard socialist  aaaaahahahahahahahaahahahadeep breathaaahahahahahhaaaaaaa
if only the republicans could match the discipline and unity seen in the socialist party  who did you guys nominate for president two years ago
the question is
i would like to point out that my actual statement was  deliberately or not there has been no communication between them and us   the  or not  part was not included in the article
it seems to be there  either way
bring in fox news evyana  i m sure they ll side with you about how racist and sexist the rest of the group is even though they never said a single racist or sexist thing when they argued against your victory  you wo nt do it because you re game will be up
who caresits a club
seriously guys i have no clue what is happening
greg jennings caught dat shit
can someone summarize this cucr controversy for me  these articles are long
the nazi mccarthyist heritage manifested in yaf purges has reappeared as the praetorian misdeed of corporate governance and fractuous republican divisions

control top is some of the funniest shit i ve ever seen  this video did nt do them justice bc the sound was shitty

prayers go out to her family
she was found during a nypd water search in the hudson on saturday afternoon
he teaches at nyu
i would like to clarify i do not in any way consider myself an expert in economic theory
thats a great rebuttal to a professor who was clearly giving a popular lecture
to be honest
i think the point is that her    article provided more evidence than the lecturer  himself  also she    clearly writes in parentheses how basic the terms and history she s mentioning isi do agree they maybe should ve started off with the disclaimer to sound less pretentious  though maybe it was an attempt to sound like an academic critic
saying he s trying to use half truths to rally an uninformed working class is completely absurd considering the context of this talkbut you know it really sounds like you ve absorbed your economics classes more than you have the history of class in this country
very insightful review  i am surprised someone actually had the guts to do a fair review of an ultra liberal lecturer
anyone expected other than insipid upperclass liberalism from anyone associated with nyu in any fashion lol
you get a b

diana
this is the most beautiful bwog comment that has ever existed  i love you
i wish i got to know you more  your voice is just beautiful and it does something to the soul  i am blessed to have been in that open mic room at the irc on 0425  this piece brought tears to my eyes because i needed to hear every word  i wish nothing but the best for you on your future endeavors
dianita      oh my you are compassion and purity  this is what wisdom is  and gah what a writer you are
have been thinking about how to write this comment for a day
saving this forever  love you forever  3 d
thank you
hahahaha
congrats max  definitely a worthy entry
editorial removal  this comment contained ad hominem hate speech
no idea who tyler dratch is
i also agree that the comment about tyler was rude
brevity is the soul of whit
back in my day  the downtown 1 train ran on weekends  so real
but actually
you may need to calm down
barely goes to columbia
omg
jesus these guys must have really rigged it then  no shit
if someone threatened violence go to campus security or feel free to out the person or screenshot the message  as one of the members against eyvana
i find it interesting that they listed as board members individuals who are incoming board members
unbreakable logic
or maybe they care more about the club than their personal gain
what else is being a republican about if not callous personal gain
all  illegitimate  voters left after the election for the second position  executive director   the remaining voting body consisted only of committed cucr members who bothered to stick around for the rest of the elections  therefore
you think maybe there is a slight possibility that is because the elections for president and vice president lasted an hour
the fact that you do nt include that critical fact tells me that you are full of it
in an internet argument
the tyranny is incredible  i can not even begin to explain how deep this goes or what kate has done  eyvana too  they canceled the meeting because we wanted to go to it and voice our opinions and they blamed the cancellation on us threatening violence which never happened  they had to lie because canceling the meeting violated the constitution
tyranny really  lol have you ever lived in an actual dictatorship  because i have and you sound like a 15 year old girl arguing with her parents
i know why they canceled it and that was because public saftey reccomended that we change the meeting to a later date  this was due to threats being made and public saftey wanting to insure everyone s saftey  i assure you the board knew this meeting was coming and the meeting was happening until public saftey gave this reccomendation
i stopped reading after  as
yeah
this is probably the stupidest thing i have seen all year long  all of this over a silly college club
i respect that point of view but you are not in our shoes  that is how we looked at it too until we were wronged  something does nt sit right inside when the happens and we have to make this right  we just wanted to be heard
ok i appreciate your viewpoint anonymous
i actually am in your shoes  i am in your club and i come a lot  i was at the elections  the idea that the elections were rigged is pretty much the stupidest thing i have ever heard  what s more is that the controversy that you guys are stirring makes the club look really really bad  so
thanks for the input
thought i d sneak a vshow reference in here  sweeping it under the rug like the prezbo administration does with all claims of sexual misconduct  but actually
they just removed the name of the members haha what is it are you embarrassed
some members are scared of the repercussions from around the university and from the well connected eboard  it is understandable
have some balls
i signed  i do nt think its wrong not to want your name out there though
you do realize the irony in your anonymous statement
wait  so the members sent a statement to bwog  then asked bwog to take down their names  and bwog agreed  what the fuck
because it s still in the original document
are here
this is stupid  if you want to put your name to a public statement you should stand by it  if not you are no better than all the anonymous butthurt bwog commentators  signed
to clear things up
nothing new here  dealt with this at 3 out of 4 cucr elections during my time  glad someone is confronting it out in the open
collegeclubsaresrsbusiness  ifyoudisagreewithmeyoureracist
wow she postponed a meeting       wtffffff
but you failed  spring 2014 is definitely third fiddle to spring 2013 and spring 2012 in terms of drama
cucr members setting the standard for complaining about idiotic things  oh the injustice    oh the tyranny
i know for a fact that eyvana s family has not flown in to new york so if you stopped being hypocrites and liars maybe it would get better
bwog
fyi all of their information is coming from a person who has nt been to a republican meeting in months  such credibility haha
and all of this information is coming from the same person flooding the comments section under multiple names pretending to be other peopleseriously  how can you point fingers at others for fabrication when that is literally what you are doing  how do you even have the nerve
the person leading this was someone brought in just to vote for bob and was barely eligible to vote she reached out to me to join their faction and i did nt even think she was in this club  ha so glad she likes feeling important driving the lie bus
way to completely evade the accusation  you are literally pretending to be two different people to make fake accusations
and i thought circa elections were bad
here s the best solution  have everyone mass quit cucr and start a new club  then the winner will be the one who killed the club  you guys also get the chance to rewrite the club s constitution so this does nt happen again  it s a win win and the drama can stop so everyone can go back to studying  i do nt get you college kids
true  and you engineers always have much better tshirts  and will probably get hired unlike anyone stupid enough to put membership in the college republicans on their resume   bottom line  let s all be engineers
it s called money  cucr has a several thousand dollar budget  a new club would only get a few hundred dollars  it has been thought of
cosponsorship
first
so you re telling me they ve seen one of andy s friends  text messages to andy  and that people in a church group are going to parties  this is a complete fabrication by some people with lax morals who are upset that the party is moving in the right directon
people in a church group going to parties
if you respect the idea that christians should be obedient
wat
some of these republcans need help
this ca nt even compare to this year s circa election
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha
it s always nice to see that the fact bobtom offered to help people get internships in exchange for voting for him  including the source of much of this post  is glossed over by bwog
always glossed over  there s been two posts  and for the record
why are you writing comments and then replying to yourself  while pretending to be someone else  stop trying to cast her in a bad light  you re pathetic
you re a terrible troll  you know people can track your comments
pointless popularity contests are serious business
so the names on this petition were taken off  that shows that these people are nt prepared to place their names on this statement  in addition
you re
help
nah
well you got them and the random bwog commenters who ve called me a  typical liberal  when i said that rape was bad
this statement is 100  true  i sat right behind andy and his friends  andy brought 4 people
i would nt want to me listed as one of bobtom s pawns either
can we talk about how you ve made six comments under pretty much as many names  we get the point
pardon me
actually
so what  you are nt exactly commenting with your full name
bwog
nope nothing to see here
either way my point is that if you click  track  you find that a bunch of these comments are coming from the same people
but it sure beats studying for finals
this is false  take me back to finals and school and all day library excursions
dude  they re the college republicans  no one cares
members signed that statement when it was meant to be a statement to be read to the board of the club
catastrophic crisis of confidence  omagashhhhhhhhhh this is so important and critical for our university
tl  dr
poor thing did they beat you at the election    your very important dad who raised you as a good republican will call his very important lawyer friends to help you out do nt worry darling and keep some space there s derby pie for dessert
everyone here needs to check their privileged there are places where people would be killed for criticizing their  democratically elected  leaders like north korea
just because some people are less privileged than us does nt mean that we should nt challenge injustice  that d be like saying we should nt have worried about civil rights in the 60s because there is famine elsewhere
are you really comparing this to the civil rights movement    haha you guys are such heroes i wish i was more like you
no
fuck you peaches ur an ass in real life
д  i m so sorry if i ve ever wronged you
we do not feel that
hey
but typos happen all the time  i ve seen them everywhere  even in briefs to federal courts  plus
here are the people who signed the document ellie dominguez
idk how you got this list
last i checked the bwog article said 13 people signed this
and you posted 15 names
and you posted 15 names
get a life guys
fuckin gdi s
this is all just really stupid  cucr is a meaningless discussion club  the stakes are getting to talk to a few insane politicians  although there were nt any speakers this year  and buying pizza for thirty members every week  i m amazed that people are wasting so much time on this  the way these people are fighting and scheming
ever drunk bailey s from a shoe  wan na go to a club where people wee on each other  you re all rigid  like a breadstick  you see
i do nt know who this is
this is typical of bob sun that he would assume that someone using the name bob is impersonating him
does anyone actually care about this or are we using this as procrastination
lol you need to get a life  do nt you have finals to study for and papers to write  you have been commenting nonstop since the first post
let them off to argentina where croat and arab nazis pork for lore enforcement  as in  fbi         instead of working
sup eyvana

speaking of
i do not get at all why the bwog senior wisdoms are such preeminent institutions at this fucking school  i just do nt understand this fascination with the campus press  do people at columbia just have nothing better to do than talk online about what other people are doing  why must ever major event warrant a media circus  why does bwog get 300 comment threads full of essay replies whenever something they review a show  it says something about columbia s complete lack of culture when it takes a shitty review for people to begin giving a shit about the students that go here
laughing at the idea of bwog bestowinggranting senior wisdoms like they rule the universe  as noted many years previously
says the dude writing a comment on bwog
says the dude writing a comment on bwog
says the dude writing a comment on bwog
because you were actually smart and hardworking and got phi beta kappa
interested in reading them
i believe you forgot a conclusion
fuck conclusions
that they mention eric donahue and sean walsh but completely ignore sam balzac s singing  you were flat
what show were you watching  sean was awesome
so the point of the show was   what  this review read as 30 disconnected observations about the show with zero engagement of whatever the show was really about  and if it was as empty as  where s prezbo   that s hardly social commentary
1 it s a review
right
go read the nyrb  then tell me again that it s impossible engage with the substance of a show in a review  i was nt arguing for a total plot summary at all
also
this was good and honest  svokos is the last voice of reason
